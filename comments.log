1659344824768 comment nokia2720 "Hi,\n\nI just wrote you an E-Mail a few days ago but there was a problem with the delivery und just today you activated the comments section :D My E-Mail was in german, therefore I translate the text:\n\nHallo,\n\nThank you for the documentation of the tweaks regarding the nokia feature phone. I own the Nokia 6400 4G an I have the typical 'double typing issue'. When a key is pressed, the hardware fires two inputs instead of one thus the software registers two inputs, which is really annoying, so instead of a 'b' sometimes there appears a 'c' etc. I could fix this in the keypad.js by simply adding a must have time of 150ms between two inputs, which solves the problem when typing text (like t9). However navigation through the system (e.g. using the D-Pad, or entering telephone numbers in the homescreen) this hack does not work, I think the keypad.js is not used there. I could not find the relevant *.js file for the system navigation and my question is, whether you have an idea where I can find it.\n\nCheers from Hamburg" "apologies about the email address, i didn't realize it broke.\nthanks for letting me know, i now replaced it with an anonaddy email address that definitely works. :)\n\nactually, about a month ago i switched back to a smartphone because i needed lot of gps lately and didn't want to carry two devices.\ni don't have my nokia on hand currently, so just speculation follows.\n\niiuc the events start from firefox and then percolate through various event handlers.\nif so, the question is, is there a way to catch the event at an earlier stage and prevent it from propagating?\nlooking at the files just from my post, i'd try looking around in hardware_buttons.js\nand see if it's possible to add `e.stopPropagation()` and `e.preventDefault()` to some relevant looking place.\n\ntry giving that a shot and let me know if it doesn't work.\ni can then dig up my old nokia give it a shot myself.\n"
1659350816884 comment nokia2720 "Thank you for the quick reply, I already had a look at hardware_buttons.js but after my first try the keys stopped working completely :D Luckily still in Debug-Mode I could re-enable the link to the original file. I will give it a second try and will let you know." ""
1665247186636 comment coregov "Where does money ultimately come from?" "i haven't thought much about it.\ni suppose there could be a central bank of some sort that can create money by loaning strategically.\nor if cryptocurrencies ever become stable enough, maybe using one of them could be fine too.\nwhile it's an interesting question, it probably doesn't really matter that much at this high level where i already assume we have a working monetary system.\n\nbut in case money is very volatile (high inflation), maybe all accounting could be done in terms of a stable commodity such as gold.\ne.g. in the school example it would mean the school gets 1 ounce of gold per kid per month.\nand then that gets converted to whatever money that is worth before each transaction.\nthis might seem very crazy but not sure if the proposed framework has any other stable means to deal with this problem."
1665249584119 comment coreedu "1. How do you prevent monopolies/anti-competitive behavior?\n\n2. What happens in rural communities that have, say, 3 kids? How do you ensure they are schooled appropriately?" "re preventing monopolies:\ni'd like to keep the barrier for starting a new school low.\nmy hope is that then competitors can easily pop up.\ni expect more specialized schools would appear this way: schools with focus on arts, sports, stem, etc.\nthen perhaps less talent goes wasted if kids are with other like-minded kids and teachers.\n\nre preventing anti-competitive behavior:\ni wouldn't build any protections against this specifically.\npeople can raise such issues to the judicial system and they will, hopefully, sort it out.\n\nre rural communities:\nno specific provisions for them.\nthe kids can either commute to the nearest school or join a school that can teach remotely.\nif the kids need additional support (e.g. commuting assistance), they can request help from their local municipality.\nexplicitly not supporting every snowflake situation helps keeping the system low complexity."

" "i started out with allowing 1 comment per hour because i wasn't sure what to expect after opening up to the internet.\nbut looks like nobody is trying to spam me so i bumped to limit to 4 comments per hour.\ni still want to keep the global limits because makes me sleep better knowing that i won't get gazillion messages overnight.\n\nbut now i also added alerts to notify me if this new limit is ever reached.\nthen i can reevaluate again if i need to further adjust the rules."
1665411845478 comment aidsim "It looks like you're over-complicating this. Since your model doesn't have feedback loops or non-random external factors you can simple do: d/dv potential*log(wealth) ∝ d/dwealth ... ∝ 1/wealth. So you maximize value by giving to the poorest.\n\n(Also, I think the term you're looking for is \"productivity\" or at least \"[economic/society] value creation\".)" "in my simulator i get a better result if i filter out both the wealthy and the unproductive people, see @/aiddist."
1665495994726 comment autotax "What is the incentive to participate in the first place? From what I can see only landowners have one. And government contractors, maybe. But you're keeping the government minimal so you don't have a lot of those." "good question, thank you! i now added a new \"adoption incentives\" section about that."
1665564033128 comment autotax "I find this topic very interesting and keep reading your posts. I also often think about alternatives to fiat money, but cannot really find a solution. I like the idea of the current system, but the central banks f*** it up by buying government bonds by creating money out of nothing and not letting bad banks and as a result bad companies go bankrupt. Good old gold is the way to go, because its amount is physically limited. Sew a thin sheet of gold of appropriate value into paper money?" "a gold-backed cash-only currency still has a lot of problems:\n\n- complex tax rules: small businesses have to do a lot of busywork to do to ensure they are paying the right amount.\n  i'd even go as far to call tax accounting as one of those meaningless bullshit jobs.\n- taxation only through violence: the government has to use physical force to repossess wealth from individuals who don't want to share.\n- wealth accumulation: a single person can accumulate a large fraction of the gold and then the rest of people remain incredibly poor.\n  often there's no incentive for the wealth owner to sensibly reinvest the accumulated wealth back into the society.\n  capital holders are not taxed, only the doers, who are actually doing something sensible who need to pay taxes.\n  this sounds crazy to me.\n- costly counterfeit protection: small businesses have to be very careful about accepting only the real cash.\n  this adds extra process and cost to the daily transactions.\n- wastes precious resources: imbuing gold into cash makes it less available for other use such as electronics.\n  similarly with bitcoin: is it really worth all the energy investment?\n\ni say eventually our society should be technologically mature enough that we should be able track and redistribute our resources with minimal overhead.\nmy proposal is one such solution."
