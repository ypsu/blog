1659344824768 comment nokia2720 "Hi,\n\nI just wrote you an E-Mail a few days ago but there was a problem with the delivery und just today you activated the comments section :D My E-Mail was in german, therefore I translate the text:\n\nHallo,\n\nThank you for the documentation of the tweaks regarding the nokia feature phone. I own the Nokia 6400 4G an I have the typical 'double typing issue'. When a key is pressed, the hardware fires two inputs instead of one thus the software registers two inputs, which is really annoying, so instead of a 'b' sometimes there appears a 'c' etc. I could fix this in the keypad.js by simply adding a must have time of 150ms between two inputs, which solves the problem when typing text (like t9). However navigation through the system (e.g. using the D-Pad, or entering telephone numbers in the homescreen) this hack does not work, I think the keypad.js is not used there. I could not find the relevant *.js file for the system navigation and my question is, whether you have an idea where I can find it.\n\nCheers from Hamburg" "apologies about the email address, i didn't realize it broke.\nthanks for letting me know, i now replaced it with an anonaddy email address that definitely works. :)\n\nactually, about a month ago i switched back to a smartphone because i needed lot of gps lately and didn't want to carry two devices.\ni don't have my nokia on hand currently, so just speculation follows.\n\niiuc the events start from firefox and then percolate through various event handlers.\nif so, the question is, is there a way to catch the event at an earlier stage and prevent it from propagating?\nlooking at the files just from my post, i'd try looking around in hardware_buttons.js\nand see if it's possible to add `e.stopPropagation()` and `e.preventDefault()` to some relevant looking place.\n\ntry giving that a shot and let me know if it doesn't work.\ni can then dig up my old nokia give it a shot myself.\n"
1659350816884 comment nokia2720 "Thank you for the quick reply, I already had a look at hardware_buttons.js but after my first try the keys stopped working completely :D Luckily still in Debug-Mode I could re-enable the link to the original file. I will give it a second try and will let you know." ""
1665247186636 comment coregov "Where does money ultimately come from?" "i haven't thought much about it.\ni suppose there could be a central bank of some sort that can create money by loaning strategically.\nor if cryptocurrencies ever become stable enough, maybe using one of them could be fine too.\nwhile it's an interesting question, it probably doesn't really matter that much at this high level where i already assume we have a working monetary system.\n\nbut in case money is very volatile (high inflation), maybe all accounting could be done in terms of a stable commodity such as gold.\ne.g. in the school example it would mean the school gets 1 ounce of gold per kid per month.\nand then that gets converted to whatever money that is worth before each transaction.\nthis might seem very crazy but not sure if the proposed framework has any other stable means to deal with this problem."
1665249584119 comment coreedu "1. How do you prevent monopolies/anti-competitive behavior?\n\n2. What happens in rural communities that have, say, 3 kids? How do you ensure they are schooled appropriately?" "re preventing monopolies:\ni'd like to keep the barrier for starting a new school low.\nmy hope is that then competitors can easily pop up.\ni expect more specialized schools would appear this way: schools with focus on arts, sports, stem, etc.\nthen perhaps less talent goes wasted if kids are with other like-minded kids and teachers.\n\nre preventing anti-competitive behavior:\ni wouldn't build any protections against this specifically.\npeople can raise such issues to the judicial system and they will, hopefully, sort it out.\n\nre rural communities:\nno specific provisions for them.\nthe kids can either commute to the nearest school or join a school that can teach remotely.\nif the kids need additional support (e.g. commuting assistance), they can request help from their local municipality.\nexplicitly not supporting every snowflake situation helps keeping the system low complexity."
1665261860877 comment comments "Globally rate limiting across the whole site discourages commenting, especially when you post 6 post at once, each of which takes less than 10min to read, digest, and formulate a comment for. " "i started out with allowing 1 comment per hour because i wasn't sure what to expect after opening up to the internet.\nbut looks like nobody is trying to spam me so i bumped to limit to 4 comments per hour.\ni still want to keep the global limits because makes me sleep better knowing that i won't get gazillion messages overnight.\n\nbut now i also added alerts to notify me if this new limit is ever reached.\nthen i can reevaluate again if i need to further adjust the rules."
1665411845478 comment aidsim "It looks like you're over-complicating this. Since your model doesn't have feedback loops or non-random external factors you can simple do: d/dv potential*log(wealth) ∝ d/dwealth ... ∝ 1/wealth. So you maximize value by giving to the poorest.\n\n(Also, I think the term you're looking for is \"productivity\" or at least \"[economic/society] value creation\".)" "in my simulator i get a better result if i filter out both the wealthy and the unproductive people, see @/aiddist."
1665495994726 comment autotax "What is the incentive to participate in the first place? From what I can see only landowners have one. And government contractors, maybe. But you're keeping the government minimal so you don't have a lot of those." "good question, thank you! i now added a new \"adoption incentives\" section about that."
1665564033128 comment autotax "I find this topic very interesting and keep reading your posts. I also often think about alternatives to fiat money, but cannot really find a solution. I like the idea of the current system, but the central banks f*** it up by buying government bonds by creating money out of nothing and not letting bad banks and as a result bad companies go bankrupt. Good old gold is the way to go, because its amount is physically limited. Sew a thin sheet of gold of appropriate value into paper money?" "a gold-backed cash-only currency still has a lot of problems:\n\n- complex tax rules: small businesses have to do a lot of busywork to do to ensure they are paying the right amount.\n  i'd even go as far to call tax accounting as one of those meaningless bullshit jobs.\n- taxation only through violence: the government has to use physical force to repossess wealth from individuals who don't want to share.\n- wealth accumulation: a single person can accumulate a large fraction of the gold and then the rest of people remain incredibly poor.\n  often there's no incentive for the wealth owner to sensibly reinvest the accumulated wealth back into the society.\n  capital holders are not taxed, only the doers, who are actually doing something sensible who need to pay taxes.\n  this sounds crazy to me.\n- costly counterfeit protection: small businesses have to be very careful about accepting only the real cash.\n  this adds extra process and cost to the daily transactions.\n- wastes precious resources: imbuing gold into cash makes it less available for other use such as electronics.\n  similarly with bitcoin: is it really worth all the energy investment?\n\ni say eventually our society should be technologically mature enough that we should be able track and redistribute our resources with minimal overhead.\nmy proposal is one such solution."
1675378895037 comment webshooter "> communication is done through peer to peer webrtc without any central server.\n\nLike, how? Paxos?" "nah, nothing fancy.\ni meant that i don't have to run the game loop on my server.\nthe first player creating a lobby room will be the server and will just replicate data between the other players.\nso there will be a central server but it will be one of the players.\n\nthe only support needed from my server is to help establish the webrtc connections.\nmy server (this blog) already has a feature for doing that in a generic manner, i just need to document it in the form of a post.\n\n"
1675494679525 comment webshooter "Never heard of WebRTC before, very interesting. I like the idea of good-old peer to peer connections, but unfortunately, this will be very hard to get established broadly, because some ISPs still do not support IPv6 -.- You would therefore need a relay server, wouldn't you?" "this is already well established and should work in most places even without a relay server.\ni've uploaded a chat demo to @/webchat in case you want to give it a quick whirl."
1677159836128 comment comments "I have a question I've been breaking my head with, probably with a simple answer if not for my lack of good understanding of the web: how do I ensure that the server responds ONLY to requests coming from my site, and no-one else?\n\nIn your implementation, when I click preview, my browser sends a message to your server, and your server responds with a token, that will allow me to post the message. On the server-side, how do you ensure that the request from my browser is coming from your website only? \n\nHow does your server know that this fetch request:\n\n  fetch('/commentsapi', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    body: `sign=${msghash}`,\n    headers: {\n      'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n    },\n  })\n\nis coming from your website, and not from any random terminal doing a CURL request with the appropriate request & headers to look like your website?\n\nI am not nitpicking on the security of the implementation here, I just want to understand how to implement this check, as I wasn't able to find any simple answer on the internet. This says it's impossible: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/246442. \n\nI'd appreciate it lots if you could point me to some reading that will help me understand this." "> On the server-side, how do you ensure that the request from my browser is coming from your website only?\n\ni don't know that what tool you post your comment with.\nyou could totally post a comment from curl too if you curl the signature before you send it back via a second curl call.\n\none protection i can do is to look at the origin http header.\nsomeone could create a page which on visit would post an anonymous comment on my page.\nbut then the origin will be the other site's domain so i can prevent that by dropping requests with unexpected origin header.\n\nbut this won't prevent someone just posting something from the terminal where they can set any header.\nfrom the terminal you can do a denial-of-service attack against me.\nall requests will come from a single place.\nwith putting some javascript contacting my page on some popular page you could mount a distributed-denial-of-service attack against my site.\nthen any visitor of your page would try to contact my site.\nbut the origin check can easily defend against this attack.\n\nthere are other approaches described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery.\n\nnevertheless, i'm having bit of a trouble with your question.\nsounds like a xy problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem).\nwhat feature are you trying to implement in your service?\n\n"
1677193303103 comment comments "Thanks for the fast response! The CSRF wiki describes some interesting solutions, thanks.\n\nHa, could be an XY problem. I'm still learning lots on how the web works. I have a website, https://aristot.io which is currently pure client-side and I want to add a commenting system to it. I don't want to rely on 3rd party, and I thought it would be a good learning project to make a simple backend for this. I am learning to create APIs with Node - seemed to be a worthy tool to invest time learning - and intend to get some basic server hosting somewhere like digital ocean and add a SQL database (probably overkill, but good for a learning project) to store comments, manage newsletter subscribers, and whatever else arises.\n\nBut I can't think of how would I ensure for example that only someone from my website would be able to make requests to my API. I don't want my DB to get spammed with data unrelated to my site. Am I thinking about this wrongly?\n\nP.S. I love the cooldown concept :)" "> [...] only someone from my website would be able to make requests to my API. I don't want my DB to get spammed with data unrelated to my site.\n\nthe former won't protect against the latter.\ni could go to your website, open the web console, and spam you with requests which would genuinely seem to come from your website.\n\nlet me try a metaphor.\nyour service is a mailbox, the browser is the postal service that delivers mail and packages to your post.\nthe postal service will ensure that it only delivers legit mail and packages.\nbut how do you prevent your local kids putting trash, flyers or real looking mail into your mailbox?\nif you want to keep it open to all, you can't really do anything against this.\nanybody will be able to put stuff into your mailbox.\nsimilarly, anybody will be able to send you random requests, even real looking ones.\n\nyou could lock your mailbox down and give the postal services the key.\nsimilarly you could only allow registered users to post.\nthen perhaps you don't even need to care where the request is coming from.\n\nnevertheless, if you want to protect your db, you need to implement a ratelimit.\nat the moment here on my site i only allow 4 comments per hour and so far the limit wasn't reached.\neven honest users might inadvertently spam you if some post gets wildly popular and the commenters start a heated discussion among each other.\nthe ratelimit would not only protect your db but also cool down the comments a bit.\n\ni would also argue to not try to do such lockdowns even if it would be technically feasible.\ninnovation is frequently about combining things unexpectedly.\nmaybe your comment section gets popular and a user wants to write an app or extension to make the commenting section better.\nthe extension could notify the users about new comments and allow quick responses.\nor maybe someone wants to create some statistics about the comments and needs to access your content programmatically.\nwhy prevent people trying to improve your site?"
1677224359140 comment comments "Okay, yes I see your point.\n\nLast thing that's still dark in my head:\n\n> maybe your comment section gets popular [...] why prevent people trying to improve your site?\n\nIf anyone has access to the API, and my website's code is open-sourced doesn't that mean that in theory someone can just clone my site, publish it under some domain/host, and then use my backend server to host the comments of *their* website? How do backends in general prevent this kind of abuse? Ratelimiting would slow-down, but still, anyone would be able to use my backend as free storage/db. Or?" "checking the origin or referer header would prevent that.\nthe users of that clone-site wouldn't be able to talk to your site if you do that.\nthis check is like two lines of code on the server side. :)\n\nbut if someone creates a tool or browser extension to talk to your site, then yeah, they could use it as a storage.\nadjust your limits in a way that it makes this impractical.\nor just limit commenting to registered users if you are concerned about unintended usage.\nif some user misuses your service, you simply ban them.\ni think banning bad users is what most sites do.\n\nbut then make sure the registration is somewhat limited (asking for money is a good deterrent) and that the new users cannot immediately spam you.\ncoming up with the right rules is a rabbit hole.\nit's best to not worry too much about it initially.\njust adjust over time based on the actual user behavior you see."
1677449450554 comment webchat "wow, thanks for this demo (i am the one from the other posting). i read about the \"chat control\" plans of the EU and am concerned, that basic rights like save communication are taken from people. client-side and server-side control could become obligatory for the major messaging platforms. a webrtc based solution could be nice, but without the use of any relay-servers." "huh, i didn't know about those plans, thanks for mentioning.\nit sounds a pretty dumb idea.\nbut look on the bright side: every time bureaucrats do something like this, the technology evolves, see what happened in the file/music sharing scene.\nas a response the more secure, less tractable, more decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging systems will get more popular.\nso the joke is on the bureaucrats.\nhaving such a chat control plan will be a net benefit for society due to its obvious unintended effects. :)\n\nalso note, this demo does not use a relay server.\nit needs a central service to help establish the connection between the two peers.\nonce established, the peers communicate directly with each other with no involvement of any central server."
1685349699850 comment shapeware "What was the trigger for writing this post?" "a few months ago i installed the signal messenger app and i was looking for a web client for it.\ni have not found it nor any indications or plans whether it's coming or never coming.\nthat made me feel uncertain about the app.\nthen i've seen that in the smartphone app you can set up monthly donations and all you get in return is just a badge.\nthat rubbed me in the wrong way.\nsince then i was ruminating how this could be improved.\nthis is the best i could come up with so far."
