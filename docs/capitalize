# capitalize: the posts will be properly capitalized from now on

I woke up one day, decided I hate capitalization (@/uppercase), and decided to not bother with capitalization in my private notes anymore.
Happened around the same time when I started this blog so I started writing in all lowercase.
Then for the last 8 years I kept going so.
This blog is sort of a cleaner extension of my private notes so I thought all-lowercase is fine here too.

But at work and in my bigger hobby projects I do use proper capitalization.
Lately I'm writing more on this site (@/slackday boosted my productivity), sometimes stuff I'd like to share with others.
I think on such posts I want to present my professional side (the capitalizing one) to avoid annoying others with my alternative writing style.
I don't want the topic of capitalization distract the main points of such posts.
The decision when I allow myself be all-lowercase vs the capitalizing one is getting harder.
Sometimes I feel the lowercase style needs more effort from me than the well trodden path of the uppercases especially when I'm writing posts about the Go programming language where the case matters a lot.

Anyway, to reduce decision fatigue I decided to start capitalizing my sentences from this year on.
Or at least try for a while and see how it feels like.
It's a bit weird that most old post are in lowercase and the newer posts are in uppercase but so what.
I'm not changing much else: I'll keep writing most posts mostly to myself so the writing remains a rambling one.
