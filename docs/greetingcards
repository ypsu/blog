# greetingcards: send a photo of yourself instead of a generic seasonal card

We get the occasional seasonal greeting cards during Easter and Christmas.
Usually it's just a generic card with a generic message.
I don't even know even who they are from.
They are for my wife because she has a social life.

But last year we got an interesting one: one that had a montage of 3 photos of their family on it.
It still had a seasonal greeting on it and a personalized message so it wasn't just the photos.
Something like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1h8dtp9/anyone_else_not_send_out_those_christmas_cards/m0tck9t/.
I quite liked it, made it more interesting, worth looking at it.

So if anyone is sending out greeting cards then I recommend doing photo cards, especially when sending to folks not tuned into the social media.
Ensure the picture is recent, seasonally themed, contains you rather than your pets, include the seasonal greeting, the date, the names of the people on the photos to jolt the memory later when the recipient's Alzheimer kicks in.

I looked this up on reddit, and here are the discussions I found:

- https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/zfwu7w/i_prefer_traditional_christmas_cards_over_photo/

- https://old.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1h8dtp9/anyone_else_not_send_out_those_christmas_cards/

The opinion on this divided.
I think people tuned into social media dislike it because this feels like more social media but the other people really like it because this is the only update they get.
I'm in the latter camp so probably that's why I like it.
The other aspect is that it works better for family updates.
If you are sending pics just from yourself then yeah, that feels weird, but I think a nice pic of you is still better than a generic card.

Not that I ever would send these things, I'm just saying if you are sending something, then make it interesting and personalized.
Otherwise might as well ask an AI to maintain your relationships.
But is it an actual relationship then?
