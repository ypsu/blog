# titles: omit periods and uppercase in title-like contexts

consider these contexts:

- book title
- section title in an article
- github issue title
- error message
- git commit's first line
- debug log message

most of these (but not all) should need only one sentence.
do you put a period after them?
how do you decide?
here are my rules:

- does the context encourage short, to the point message?
  no period!
- would it be common to put the message in quotes or use it in a sentence?
  e.g. in the issue "race condition in foo" you said x.
  no period!
- put a period everywhere else.
  e.g. add period to the debug logs.
  it's not uncommon to have a log message with 2 or 3 sentences, so a period is warranted.

and furthermore: if you don't need a period, you shouldn't need uppercase either!
so a book title or the first line of a git commit should not start with uppercase!
go error strings are like this.
no periods, no capitals: https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/decisions#error-strings.

consider these things like sentence fragments but not a full sentence.
"topic phrase" might the correct technical term for these, dunno.

i'm well aware that the lowercase ship has sailed a long time ago: people are used to uppercase way too much.
but here's a trick for git commits and issue titles: use the "$module: title" pattern.
think of "module" as a go module where the style is to use lowercase.
then the lowercase style will be more natural, easier to swallow for others.
e.g. you are adding a new a string conversion method to the standard strconv library: "strconv: parse integers with Ki/Mi/Gi suffixes".
or if ui animations in a product are distracting, you can open a github issue titled like this: "ui: allow disabling animations".
look, no uppercase needed!

also notice that it's easy for me to put the sentence's ending period after the closing quote when i am quoting these titles.
i know that's not the official english rule but my ocd tells me that the period must be after the closing quote.
moving the trailing period out of the quotes is just extra nuisance when concatenating these strings programmatically.
on the other hand i really don't like two periods like this: "some title with period.".
no such problem when the titles contain no periods.

!html <p>title like <a href=#>strconv: parse integers with Ki/Mi/Gi suffixes</a> might be styled as a link rather than put into quotes so that people can click on it.
!html that flows pretty naturally into a sentence even without the quotes.
!html but a title like <a href=#>Some title with uppercase and period.</a> styled as a link doesn't due to that ugly uppercase and period.</p>

i didn't find much discussion about this on the internet hence thought i come up with my own rules for myself to apply in my life.

here are some discussions i found.
i'll add better ones if i find them:
