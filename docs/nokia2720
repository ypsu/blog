# nokia2720: tweaking and using the nokia 2720 kaios phone.

as i described in @/phones, i wanted a new non-smartphone.
so i decided to get a nokia 2720 4g (2019) flipphone.
i have a pic at @/phones.jpg that shows
how it looks like in terms of size compared to my nokia 105 (2013)
which was made obsolete by the 2g network shutdown in my area
and pixel 4 that i used while i was waiting for the new phone.
as you can see, it's bigger than my old phone.
but that's still pretty much the smallest non-2g phone i found.

this phone runs kaios.
kaios is a linux that runs some old version of firefox
and all the apps on it are just html5 websites.
it's a fork of firefox os and is optimized for phones with keypads.

and as expected, by the default it comes with lots of quirks
that i needed quite some time to reconfigure.
fortunately it's relatively easy to tweak the phone
so at least that prevents one from getting unreasonably angry
about the "design choices" its developers have made.

let me document the tweaks i needed to make.
i'll try to be detailed
so that if i ever need to switch to another kaios phone,
i'll be able to set it up from scratch again.

there's a site called bananahackers.
it's a collection of guides scraped from some kaios mailing list.
it's a bit annoying site but it was very useful for me to figure out things.

there's quite a few hacks i did.
some are straight from bananahackers, some are my own findings:

- deleted all crapware from it.
  it came with about 30 apps, i now have only 9 of them.
- enabled call recording.
- disabled answer on flip open.
- disabled the startup sound.
- made typing numbers faster.
- replaced my alarm clock sound.
- made the assistant button toggle the flashlight.
- removed the toaster notification when switching cases/t9.
- made the alarm clock time setting ui more usable.

if you decide to go down this path then make sure you don't make a mistake.
it's very easy to mess up the whole phone and turn it into a brick.
i managed to make a mistake when editing the launcher's source
and the phone's ui got completely broken.
fortunately i could still start wallace-toolbox with gdeploy or webide
so i could reenable root and push a fix.
had i messed up the system app, then things would have been much harder.

note that all the patches below are against kaios 2.5.2.
an upgrade would probably invalidate most of my hacks
so i hope it won't come anytime soon.
although you can easily turn the updates down if needed.

# tweaking

so let's start.
i assume linux as your hacking device.
the tools you need are: adb and kaiosrt.
kaiosrt is basically just an old firefox that still has webide enabled.
you would use that to sideload apps to the phone
or to tweak some hidden settings.
alternatively you can use gdeploy to sideload apps.
i prefer the latter since you can easily run it from the command line.
software sources:

- adb: get it from your linux distro's package manager.
- gdeploy: https://gitlab.com/suborg/gdeploy/ (needs npm)
- kaiosrt: https://developer.kaiostech.com/simulator/linux
- wallace-toolbox: https://gitlab.com/suborg/wallace-toolbox/

enable debugging mode with "*#*#33284#*#*".
a little bug icon should appear in the top status bar.
now connect the phone to your computer via its usb cable.
the device should appear when you run "adb devices".

use gdeploy to install the wallace-toolbox app.
in that app you can enable call recording.
i've enabled it because i have terrible hearing
and would prefer to listen back to some conversations
to ensure i picked up correctly everything.
the conversations will appear in a callrecording folder on its internal storage.
use mtp (e.g. mount it via go-mtpfs) to get to the folder when connected to it.

use wallace-toolbox to enable the developer menu.
this unlocks a new option in the settings (settings->device->developer)
where you can toggle the debug mode without needing to remember the code.

use wallace-toolbox to make all apps removable.
then you can use the right soft key in the launcher to bring up the menu
that will now contain an uninstall option for all apps.
i only kept these:

- messages
- call log
- contacts
- camera
- gallery
- clock
- settings
- stk (sim toolkit): i'd prefer to remove this one but it keeps reappearing.
- wallace toolbox

that's 9 apps.
it fits one screen without scrolling so that's nice.
i think the rest is unneeded.
just use an actual computer to do the rest of the stuff
(e.g. browsing, gps, listening to recordings, radio, snake, etc).

use wallace-toolbox to enable adb root too.
after that "adb shell" will log you in as root
and you will be able to overwrite the builtin apps this way.
you'll need to enable this after each reboot
so maybe keep wallace-toolbox around
or somehow make this autoenabled on boot.

there's one more easy setting you can do: disable the flip to answer.
i often want to reject a call so that i can call back immediately.
i'm on a company paid plan with unlimited calls
so it's simply more cost effective for me to call back my wife.
for that i need to open my phone, reject the call, and then call back.
to set this up, start up kaiosrt and connect to the device.
in it go to runtime -> device settings,
find the option phone.answer.flipopen.enabled and set it to false.
you might need to reboot.
i've learned this one from the r/kaios subreddit.

# advanced tweaking + disabling the startup sound

all the system apps live at /system/b2g/webapps.
in order to replace some of them,
you need to copy the target app to /data/local/webapps
and point the app's dir to the new path.
to do that you need to edit /data/local/webapps/webapps.json
and change the target app's basePath property to /data/local/webapps.

let's start with the disabling the startup sound tweak to demo all this.
keep in mind that all the patches i show are against the formatted code.
just use a js formatter to reformat the files and then they are easy to edit.
i used clang-format with the google style but beware
clang-format seems to mess up code
where there's a missing semicolon at the end of the line.
by messing up i mean the code won't work anymore.
maybe apply the patches manually on the unformatted code directly.

to disable the startup sound, first grab the system app:

  adb pull /system/b2g/webapps/system.gaiamobile.org

a system.gaiamobile.org directory should appear in your current directory
and it should contain a file called application.zip.
it's best if you can edit the files right in the zip file
so that you don't need to unzip/rezip the contents.
modern distributions of vim can do this already
but probably other modern editors too.

apply this patch either manually or via patch:

  diff -rpu base/system.gaiamobile.org/js/init_logo_handler.js mine/system.gaiamobile.org/js/init_logo_handler.js
  --- base/system.gaiamobile.org/js/init_logo_handler.js

         if (e.detail.type !== 'system-first-paint') {
           return;
         }

i just pretty much completely disable the startOsLogoSound function's body.
after you made this change push this back to to the phone:

  adb push system.gaiamobile.org /data/local/webapps

notice that this time we are pushing to /data/local/webapps.
make sure to edit /data/local/webapps/webapps.json too:

  adb pull /data/local/webapps/webapps.json
  sed -i '/system.gaiamobile.org/,/^  }/s:/system/b2g/webapps:/data/local/webapps:' webapps.json
  adb push webapps.json /data/local/webapps/

then reboot the phone for it to pick up the new system app:

  adb reboot

there shouldn't be any startup sound.
all changes below need a reboot in order for the phone to pick them up.

from now i'll just show the patches i used for the various tweaks.
make sure to pull and push each of the change the same way as the system app.

# type numbers faster

this tweak is from the bananahackers site.
basically if you want to type in a number while typing a message,
you can long press a button to make it a number.
but the duration is overly long so you can lower that like this:

# replace the alarm clock sound

i didn't find an option to use custom sounds for the alarm clock.
it's entirely possible i just missed an option for this.
but what i did is that i just replaced

  clock.gaiamobile.org/shared/resources/media/alarms/ac_woody.ogg

with a custom ogg file and pushed the clock app back to my phone.

i really hated the default selection.
i dislike alarms that suddenly scare me awake.
what i want is some white noise that gets louder slowly.
i downloaded some 1 minute rain mp3 from some sound sharing site,
opened it in audacity, applied a fade in effect over the whole sound,
exported it to ogg, and then put it into the clock's application.zip.
it worked just fine.

# make the assistant button toggle the flashlight

it baffles me that the "assistant button" is not configurable on this phone
and it defaults to that useless google assistant thingie
that i immediately deleted.
a much better use for that button would be to toggle the flashlight.

however i don't want the pressing itself to be the flashlight toggle.
i want to reserve that for checking the time.
i want to hold the button for a little while to toggle it.
i managed to set this up.

there is already some support in the code for holding down the button.
that's what triggers the assistant.
it needs a bit practice to get the hang of it though.
i think that's because of the phone's deep sleep mode.
the first time you press the button,
the code can't seem to be able to successfully set up any timers
or do any time related operations.
so the first time you press the button, you basically turn the phone up.
then the clock should now be visible on the external screen.
only now try to hold the button to toggle the flashlight.
if you omit the wakeup part, the holding won't work.

however there's also support for double tapping
which activates the same function as the holding.
at first i didn't disable the double tapping.
but then during daytime i sometimes noticed
that the flashlight was unexpectedly on.
that explained why on some days the battery drained faster than the rest.
this was quite a mystery for me but slowly i figured it out.

i often quickly check the time: i tap the button twice rapidly.
if it's daylight and this enables the flashlight, i simply won't notice.
furthermore, often it didn't enable the flashlight on the second tap.
it enabled it the next time i've checked the time.
i think that's because the second tap enables the flash
and suspends the phone at the same time.
but the latter action happens sooner.
so the phone only enables the flash on the next wakeup
when i check the time next time.
this is not a problem with the holding
because the code enables the flash while you hold the button
and only suspends the phone after you release the button.

this bit of the code was quite tricky to get right.
most combinations of changing the existing code simply didn't work reliably.
in fact, the unmodified existing code didn't work reliably at all.
i'm not sure what testing did people do on this.
this piece of code is also meant for handling the emergency sos calls
if you enable that in the accessibility settings.
but it simply doesn't work unless you tap + hold or tap like gazillion times
and hope that you manage trigger the code in the right manner.
to be fair, if you enable wifi/data and the phone never sleeps
then this is probably not a problem.
but make sure you don't trust your life to a kaios device in any case.

anyways what worked in the end was this:
on keydown, enable the external screen if it wasn't yet
and set up a timer to toggle the flashlight.
on keyup cancel the timer and turn off the screen
if we didn't turn it on with this button.
it took me quite a while to come up with this
but now it works quite reliably with the tap + hold pattern.

oh and i also changed the default timeout for holding from 3 seconds to 600 ms
because the former just felt too long.

here's the glorious patch.
note that it changes two system applications.

# remove the toaster notification when switching cases/t9

when typing a message,
you can press # to switch between T9, Abc, abc, ABC, 123 input modes.
the current mode is always displayed in the status bar.
however when you switch
a slow "toaster" popup drops down from the top
and is displayed for about a second showing the new mode.
if you want to switch rapidly between modes
then you simply don't know what the current mode is
because this silly popup keeps hiding the actual state.
i found a way to remove this redundant popup:

btw, if you didn't know, if you long press #

that's quite handy for t9 input.
i keep the toaster popup for that case since that's not indicated on top.

# made the alarm clock time setting ui more usable.

the time entry in the alarm clock app is quite weird.
what i'd prefer is that i press "1234" to set an alarm for 12:34.
instead, i need to press "12<right arrow>34" to enter that.
i want the input field to automatically jump to the minutes field

here's a patch to do that.

# review

phew, that's all the hacks i made.
now the phone became quite usable for me.
i have a few more generic thoughts.
note that i only care about the dumbphone qualities.
fancy stuff like camera, music, browsing, apps interest me not.
if someone is into that then they are probably better off with proper androids.

# battery

the battery level is shown via an icon in the status bar.
i wanted to make it show percentages but i think it's a nontrivial change.
each tenth level has a separate icon.
the icons themselves are in a ttf file.
they are unicode glyphs from unicode's private range.
it's not impossible to make this work, i just didn't care enough about it.
i can live with icons too.

you can check the exact battery percentage in the settings though,
see settings -> device -> battery.
you don't even need to get into the battery menu,
it will display the percentage while you are in the device menu already.
once in the settings, pressing left, left, up will get you to a place
where you can see the battery after a second or two.

i was quite worried about the battery life.
the most promising customer review said it lasts 4 days.
that would be annoying but i still gave this phone a shot.
i don't need any internet on my dumbphone
so i disabled wifi and cellular data on it.
i disabled gps too.
i even switched the phone to strictly 3g mode
since according to nokia's own documentation
the battery lasts for 28 days in 3g mode, but only 20 days in 4g mode.

to my surprise the battery life is quite reasonable!
at the time of writing i'm on day 20 without charging and i still have 6% left.
and i used the alarm multiple times a day each day (with vibration),
some calls here and there,
accidentally kept the flashlight on for a few hours now and then.
otherwise on my light usage days it uses up about 4% battery.
i'm quite satisfied with it.

# physical properties

the phone's body is made of very slippery plastic.
it slips very easily on a table.
i'm not sure this is good or not, it doesn't really bother me.

you can open and close the phone with one hand
but requires some practice until you get the hang of it.
i feel it's harder than it should be.
it's quite odd to me that this got a design award
since it feels it could be much better:
e.g. some hole on the side with which you could open it easier.

the flip works fine but i feel it won't last 6 years.
i feel i'll have to replace this phone sooner than my previous 2g dumbphone.
not that i see anything wrong with the design,
just a general experience that whatever that moves will break down with time.
each time i want to set/disable an alarm (multiple times a day)
i have to open and close the phone.
i'm sure that will wear the hinge down.

the vibrator on it is quite reasonable too.
the vibrator on the pixel4 was very weak.
i barely noticed it when it was on a desk
while i was in an otherwise quiet room.
no such problem with the nokia 2720.

# software

the call quality is pretty good, even in 3g mode.
the phone can be set to be adequately loud too.
my old nokia 105 was very quiet, so this is a big upgrade for me.
it can do loudspeaker and you can attach headphones too.
i tried it with a non-mic'd headphone
but then i had to continue speaking into the phone.
the phone has to be open because it drops the call when you close it.

i don't like the phone's font setting.
it's either huge or enormous.
it can barely fit a single message on the screen.
this is probably also hackable, but i didn't bother.
my goal is to use the phone very little
so i can live with this inconvenience.

the keyboard seems fine so far, i can type easily.
it's pretty much what you would expect from a phone like this.
i can't really talk about the quality of its t9,
i don't write enough to be able to tell.
i haven't really used t9 before anyways.
i can easily switch t9's language on the fly
by holding down the # key so i might start finally writing via t9.

when closed and you press any of the side buttons once,
the external screens turns on and shows the clock for you.
every time you do this,
it shows the previous time for a very small fraction of a second
before it updates to the actual time.
i suspect it doesn't bother rerendering the screen
while the phone is sleeping which is good.
but it also demonstrates just how slow webtech is for simple things
like showing the clock.
this "update time after turning on the screen" is also present
when you open the phone.
even there you'll see the previous time for a small fraction of a second.
the effect is more visible in this mode
since it uses an animation to update the clock's digits.
it doesn't really bother me though.

the messaging app is threaded.
so the messages from a specific person are in a single screen
rather than spread across multiple messages like in my old phone.
that's fine although sometimes my message doesn't show up in the thread
after i've sent it.
i have to quit the app and reopen it to make it appear.

the volume buttons on the side have a quirk too.
they set the volume of the current app.
if you happen to close the flip when an app is open (e.g. messaging or alarm),
then the volume keys will adjust the "media volume".
if you want it to adjust the ringtone volume,
you have to exit all apps, go back to the main screen,
and only then close the phone.

# alarm clock

the alarm clock has some quirks due to the phone being suspended all the time.
it doesn't trigger exactly at the desired time,
it can delay almost up to a minute.
and because it starts later,
it sometimes doesn't even sound for a full minute, but stops early.
if you have a very slowly rising alarm then this might be a problem.

once i managed to completely miss an alarm.
i've set the alarm to 05:00 and went to bed.
in the morning i slowly became awake
and started wondering what's the time.
i've pressed the assistant button (that turns on the external screen)
and it showed 05:13 and lo and behold the alarm started sounding.
so this means i wasn't notified about the 05:00 alarm at all.
or if it did notify, it was too short for me to wake up.
i don't really mind becoming an alarm a minute or two later.
but 10+ minutes is too much.

i'm not the only one describing this problem,
just look at these posts and their comments:

fortunately the second thread explains the solution.
don't quit the alarm app, just minimize it.
press back to minimize the app,
don't press the end call button to leave.
or don't even bother quitting the app, just close the flip while it's running.
i've started doing that and from that point i had no issues.
it doesn't seem to affect the battery life.

had i not seen this solution, i probably would have written my own clock app
that never stops playing the sound until i stop it.
but with the above hack i don't need to bother.

now i can't stop wondering
what interface would i make for a poweruser alarm clock app.
allow me to indulge on this fantasy while on topic.
all i need is a multiline textbox
where the line format would be "hhmm[flags] arbitrary_comment".
it would be trivial to maintain even multiple alarms in it
and would be trivial for the app to figure out the next alarm.
i could simple write

  0500n wake up!
  0930 go for a walk!

to set up two alarms.
the n flag would mean no vibration.
i could have an x flag to mean a disabled alarm.
so after waking up and stopping the alarm,
the app would put an x after the wakeup entry:

  0500nx wake up!
  0930 go for a walk!

this auto-x could be prevented with, say,
an r flag which would mean a repeating alarm.
the ui would always show the next alarm
so i can have the confidence that i've set up the alarms correctly.
easy peasy and very straightforward to implement.
i don't understand why people bother with complicated uis
that need megabytes of code to implement the simplest of things.

anyways.

# summary

apart from the big size, i think i'm generally happy with the phone so far.
probably won't last forever
but hopefully by that time there will be other small 3g phones to choose from.

# edit from 2021-09-29 (7 months after the original post): some battery data

the battery lost a bit of its oomph over time.
over the few past weeks
i've tracked how many days it took to get to a given percentage level from 100%
given my light usage (alarm clock in the mornings and the occasional calls):

  percentage | days
  -----------+-----
         12% |  13d
         21% |  10d
         17% |  14d
         37% |  10d
         23% |  12d
         14% |  14d

i didn't let it reach 0% since i was actually using the phone and had to keep it charged.
the point is that i can easily get 2 weeks out of it
but i think initially it managed to last longer.
anyway, i'm still happy with the phone.
i think i made a good choice here.

# edit from 2022-03-08 (1 year after the original post)

i'm now using this phone for over year a now.
i'm pretty satisfied with it, no regrets.
its battery can still last 2 weeks easily if i barely use it.

i sort of expected that the flipping hinge might break by this time but nope:
it still works just as it did on the first day.
i guess i had overly low expectations for consumer tech these days.

it now gives me the option to upgrade the operating system to a newer version.
but i'm totally not going to press that.
i don't want to through this customization nightmare again.
fortunately this option is hidden in the settings,
it doesn't pester me about it.

in any case, after 1 year of use i can still recommend this phone
if someone is looking for a not-smartphone
and is willing to invest some time and effort into the necessary customizations.

this phone was all good but i decided to switch back to a smartphone.
see @/smartphone for the reason.
