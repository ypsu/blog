# sembr: use semantic linebreaks for plaintext.

- semantic linebreaks is an old idea where you put newlines after thought ends.
- basically a newline after the periods or thought joining commas.
- i'm using lists here to better showcase
  how this could look like if well presented.
- previously i used to format my plaintext to 80 characters.
- i never really liked the "write a paragraph per line" style of editing.
- now i think semantic linebreaks are superior to 80 character wrapping.
- first, it has many technological advantages.
- you don't have to reformat your lines after each edit.
- that takes out a lot of churn out of this old style text editing.
- making edits with a line oriented editor like vim also gets easier.
- it's super easy to shuffle text around, or just rewrite small parts.
- such edits look much simpler in text diffing tools too.

- then there's the other, emotional aspect of it.
- now keep in mind, that i still limit myself to 80 characters per line.
- with sembreaks this means that all my thoughts must fit 80 characters.
- i still permit separate clauses to spill onto separate lines though.
- i used this style for a few weeks now in personal writing.
- it does feel that it makes my sentencer simpler, perhaps more childish.
- but i feel more clarity out of them.
- this way i must find the beginning and the end of each thought.
- each thought must be short and must stand on its own.
- i can't drone on and on without saying anything.
- i feel that this creative limitation helps me to think.
- it forces me to break down those swirling thoughts into digestible pieces.

- i think, though not sure how to show, but this makes reading easier too.
- think of the process of programming.
- we also put all the statements onto their own, separate lines.
- it would look weird if you would format code to 80 characters.
- it just feels cleaner when done this way.
- so why wouldn't we want this extra clarity from ordinary text too?

- this method does make text use up more vertical space.
- in some cases this can be a disadvantage.
- perhaps in the ancient times the paper was expensive.
- or people don't like overly thick books.
- but on computer screen i think the extra height is not an issue.

- i tried to convert ordinary text into sembreak'd style with this script:

  document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/[:;.?!,] /g, '$&<br>')

- it didn't work.
- if something wasn't written with the 80 character / thought limit,
  then sembreaks won't make it easier to read.

- it also initally makes the text to look like poetry.
- it adds some rythm to the text and it feels a little bit weird to read.
- search for "ventilated prose" and see the discussion around this.
- with that search term you'll see so other examples of this style.
- but i see that a lot of examples are splitting mid-thought.
- they use super narrow margins.
- they never really recommend a specific character limit.
- they let people go with their gut feelings of what is long.
- i don't really like this approach, i prefer static limits.

- there's also a lot of discussion about how manual wrapping is 70-ies tech.
- that this day and age we should just write full paragraphs per line.
- i don't really have a good argument against this.
- if people don't mind relying on fancy text editors for text editing,
- then they should go for it.
- i'm old school, and i like relying on less tech to do simple things.
- hence i wrap manually and now semantically.
- besides, if you write markdown or html, the renderers will reformat anyways.

- i started writing my personal emails with this style.
- my emails are always plaintext.
- looks like nobody was bothered enough to complain about this style.
- maybe people don't mind reading text like this.
- i'm now trying to write my work emails like this too and see how it goes.
- maybe the idea catches on eventually.
- maybe someone else will start communicating with me with this style.
- then, hopefully, i'll be able to tell if it really makes things nicer or not.
- for now i'll just keep the solo experiment going.

- edits: changed this post to use lists to demonstrate the idea.
- i no longer adhere to the 80 character limit
- and i'm experimenting with html email.
- but i'll write about that in a later post.
