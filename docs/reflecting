# reflecting: reflect regularly!

one thought stuck with me from my previous post, /grow.
in there i propose that one should occasionally write answers to 4 questions.
to recap, let me list those 4 questions along with a single word
that summarizes the question's intent:

- achievement:
  what achievement of yours are you the most proud of from the past few months?
- failure: what are you not so proud of from the past few months?
- goal: name a goal for the next few months.
- peers: name a few people who you interacted with a lot in the past few months.

i think these are pretty good questions:
they don't overwhelm you because they only ask you to list one answer.
even answering with one short sentence is enough.
and just because you list at least one answer,
it already bumps you out of a fully autopilot life.

in that post i suggest
that people work on these questions regularly with a mentor.
however what if someone doesn't have a mentor?
well, i think one should still ask those questions from themselves regularly.

i think i'll give it a shot every 4 months or so.
i tried answering those questions and they are not that easy.
as an example here's what i came up with yesterday after some pondering
(keep in mind that the answers are about the surrounding +/- 4 months):

- achievement: i've created a good daily routine.
- failure: i still distracted myself too often with pointless internet surfing.
- goal: find an accountability partner to grow my peer list.
- peers: ak (initials only)

it took me a while to answer those questions
but now i feel i have a bit more clarity about where i am and where am i going.
although i'll try to do this regularly but probably i won't do it publicly.
i feel doing it publicly would prevent being fully honest with the answers.
the answers could often require a lot of personal context
that would just not make sense without that extra knowledge.
e.g. my "goal" has more nuance to it that i didn't elaborate above.
or one might not want to publicize their failures and aspirations.
though i might change my mind and i'll just keep updating this post
or add a new post for every reflection point even if things don't make sense.

note that this reflection doesn't necessary come with any commitments.
for instance i can now decide
how disturbing the procrastination mentioned in the failure question is.
if it is, i might start tracking it or try to prevent it.
or i might just make a mental note of it (raise mental awareness)
and see how it changes over time.
furthermore, i might make plans to achieve my goal or i might not.
but i can certainly give it an occasional thought
how could i come nearer the goal.

doing it every 4 months means 3 reflection points in a year.
i find that not too frequent and not too rare:
it's just 4 questions that need single sentence answer after all.

i think i'll be able to tell if this is valuable or not
after i did it a few times and have some historical data.
so maybe after a year or two i'll know.
it's a cheap experiment to try.

# 2021-05-28 (4 months update)

- achievement: quite enjoyed work lately, felt productive, got good rating.
- failure: some stuff almost happened,
  but actually no progress on accountability partner front.
  starting to doubt i actually need this.
- goal: try out a very specific new hobby
  that might replace my need for the accountabilty partner.
- peers: ak

# 2021-09-26 (4 month update)

it's time for my second reflection update.
well, i think i've managed to make some of the things i wanted
but i've failed to fully go through my idea from the previous update.
tbf, it was very vaguely defined, i don't even remember what it was exactly
because i didn't write it down.
i'll definitely annotate my journal with more specific notes in the future.
and i'll aim at specific actions that are easy to measure success with.

i'll stop tracking the peers section from this point on.
i'm way too introvert.
i don't mingle with others, so it's just too depressing too track this.
i don't i really need/miss such mingling anyways.
if i'd feel overly isolated, i'd probably continue to track this though.

also, i think i'll bump the update period to 5 months.
i think the updates should be not divisible by the number of months in a year.
this way each update is done at some different time rather than at the same time each year.
it makes it less of a seasonal thing and thus less boring hopefully.

- achievement: i've managed to finish the golang rewrite of my server
  that i was wanting to finish for a quite a while now.
- failure: inadequate notes and tracking for my previous goal.
  at least now i know that i need to write things down, not just make mental notes
  when it comes to reflecting.
- goal: i'll add a new, special activity to my "monthlies".
  i've added details about this to my journal file under today's entry.
  more on these in a future post.
