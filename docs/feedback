# feedback: give me feedback via the updated commenting system

I updated the feedback system on this blog.
Now this site lets the readers give me feedback both in the form of a comment or a reaction.

- Guests:
  Readers can register an account on @/account or just comment away anonymously.
  In the latter case a guest account is auto-created upon interaction.
- Threading:
  It uses the github discussions inspired model.
  Each top level comment starts a thread.
  Users can either reply to a thread or start a new one.
  This model allows parallel discussions while at the same time avoids the usability horrors of the tree-model.
- Cooldown:
  Leaving a comment consists of the following phases: write comment, press preview, wait for the cooldown to pass, send comment.
  The separate preview phase reduces the chance of accidentally sending incomplete messages, reduces the need for edits.
  The @/cooldown dynamically increases as more comments get posted.
  It's meant to slow down discussion to keep things manageable and to ensure commenters take a breath before posting too much emotion.
  Guests have a higher cooldown period compared to registered users.
- Limits:
  Comments are limited to 2k bytes.
  It's an arbitrary limit.
  The comment section lets readers shout at me when I say something stupid but it's not a soapbox.
- Markdown:
  Comments have reduced markdown features.
  E.g. links are not allowed to make spamming not be worth it here.
- Reactions:
  Sometimes people do want to give some feedback to me or to a comment but leaving a full comment with +1 clutters the discussion (see https://go.dev/wiki/NoPlusOne).
  Reactions in a discussion is efficient so this site provides them.
  Readers can react both to my posts and any other comment other readers made.
  There's a small smiley button for it at the bottom left of the main post and each comment.
  I use the ideas described in @/reactions to ensure each reaction provides a strong signal.
  I made the process multi-click to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
  They are anonymous in order to increase the honesty.
  Note though that as an admin I can look up the username of each reaction so be nice.
- Slow reactions update:
  The reaction counters are updated only once a day.
  The primary reason for this is to avoid making this site too addictive.

The previous system's description is at @/comments.
It's all obsolete now.
My @/feedbackbg post talks a little bit about the background.

# Plans

For now the system is pretty barebones.
But I will consider the changes if the needs arise:

- Add the possibility for users to edit their own messages.
  I will consider this if people ask for it or if I feel the need for it.
- Add moderation features so that I can easily edit or hide messages I don't like.
  My site, my rules.
  Do it in a transparent way though, so any edits from me should be apparent.
- Enable additional markdown features for some trusted users (e.g. links).
- Restrict commenting only to registered users only if I ever reach the state where guests comment too much or I get too much spam.

Does this silly blog warrant such a complicated system for commenting?
Probably not.
But I like experimenting with stuff so might as well do it in my hidden corner of the internet.
