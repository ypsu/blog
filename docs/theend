# theend: looks like this blog is finished.

i have a goal to make at least one post each month.
but i haven't posted anything in the past 2 months.
it means i'm dead or otherwise incapacitated.
i've programmed this post to auto-appear 3 months after the last post.
i didn't want to end this blog via the silent treatment.
it's weird to be blogging from the afterlife but here i am.

don't expect new posts anytime soon.
i expect that fly.io will soon deactivate my account due to inactivity and then this site will go offline for good.
there's still a public backup at https://ypsu.github.io/blog.
that might work for some additional time.
once that's gone, i'm gone for good.

so long, and thanks for all the fish!
