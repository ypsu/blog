# theend: looks like this blog is finished

I have a goal to make at least one post each month.
But I haven't posted anything in the past 2 months.
It means I'm dead or otherwise incapacitated.
I've programmed this post to auto-appear 3 months after the last post.
I didn't want to end this blog via the silent treatment.
It's weird to be blogging from the afterlife but here I am.
Don't worry, I don't mind being dead, see @/mementomori.

Don't expect new posts anytime soon.
I expect that fly.io will soon deactivate my account due to inactivity and then this site will go offline for good.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
