# aieditor: AI is a pretty good editor

!html <em>Context: <a href=aicritic>@/aicritic</a>.</em>

Ever wanted to have a professional editor proofreading your texts?
I certainly did so after reading https://mtlynch.io/editor/.
The downside: it's expensive, slow, requires talking to humans.

I never tried that.
Basic vim spellchecking and listening to my text were my only ways to reduce typos.
It wasn't very effective if you look at my old posts.

I'm wary of using AI because I fear it will dullen my already weak writing skills.
But I guess it doesn't hurt to experiment with it now and then to see what it's capable of.
So from now on my posts might have AI suggestions incorporated (this post included).

I'm still sticking to my golden rule: never copy-paste from AI.
I'll prompt it "$REQUEST the following draft blog post: $CONTENT".
$REQUEST is something like this:

- Shorten ...
- What is the biggest issue in ...
- What disengages the reader in ...
- What text-only change could improve the engagement in ...
- Fact check ...
- Tell me the grammar issues in ...

Then I read what the AI tells me, and manually incorporate the better suggestions into my text.
So every letter here is still hand-typed, even if I now take tips from AIs.
So far I like the AI suggestions.
Anyway, disclaimer given, let's see how this affects my future posts.
(Will I eventually resort to vibe-blogging?
I hope not.)

Is AI-polished text something you mind reading?
