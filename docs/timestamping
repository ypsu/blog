# timestamping: i don't timestamp my posts

i am somewhat on the fence with regards adding timestamps to my posts. i want my
posts to contain only the content and nothing else. i want my posts to stand on
their own with no regards to posting time. when i wrote a post is usually
irrelevant anyways. on the other hand it is nice to see a rough indication of
the age of the post. hah, this reminds me of some weirdness i used to see on
some blogger.com sites. the posts and comments would have a timestamp in the
month, day, hour:minute:second format. awesome. a timestamp accurate to the
second. the only part missing? the year. because obviously that was not as
important as the seconds. i actually seen this in a lot of such blogs. super
weird. fortunately i have not encountered this recently so i am assuming this
got fixed or i managed to avoid blogger.com blogs.

anyways, this leads me to the idea that perhaps just stamping the posts with the
year they were written would be useful. i write only a couple posts per year so
i think the year granularity is more than enough. but still, i do not want to
put this metadata spam into my post contents. i have decided to just put it onto
the frontpage. so instead of:

- /post3 baz
- /post2 bar
- /post1 foo

i would have this:

2019 entries:

- /post3 baz

2018 entries:

- /post2 bar
- /post1 foo

looks a bit ugly but it does the job so i will go with it for now.

i realized that i do need to track when i wrote a post
so that i can sort the posts on the frontpage.
otherwise i need to maintain the order myself
and that's more work than adding a timestamp.

i decided i might as well show this info in the posts
so now each post has a footer with the timestamp.
but i still keep the frontpage clear of this spam for now.
