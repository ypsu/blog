# yogurt: the cherry emmi yogurt is my favorite.

this is a post for my own reference in case i ever forget this tidbit because of old age or whatever.
i quite like yogurts in general as dietary entertainment.
i'm not entirely sure what they are made of and i probably don't want to know.
i guess i like their creaminess.
finding the perfect yogurt is pretty hard though.
but i think i've managed to do so this time.
it's the emmi's cherry yogurt here in switzerland.
you can get it in many places, including coop and lidl.

it's one that you need to mix up: the cherry sauce is at the bottom.
it has a pretty good tasting sauce.
but the white cream at top is a bit sweet on its own, so it can be eaten alone too.
it's best if you don't fully mix the sauce and the white cream
but eat it like the way it is pictured on its cup (see pic below).
for some reason this cherry flavor goes well with the yogurt cream
unlike, say, chocolate which is a bit weird (though i like that too).

if you ever wanna try a yogurt, try this one:
