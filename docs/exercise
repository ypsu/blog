# exercise: do the minimum effective dose of exercise every day

I want to avoid being overly unfit without spending too much time on exercise.
So for the past few years I have done a small <10 minute exercise almost every day.
The exact approach varied over time but now there are two types of exercises:

- Hard ones where I can do only a few reps, for example pushups, pullups, curls with heavy weights.
  These I count manually to my desired target and do 2 sets of reps.
- Easy ones that I can do for minutes, for example plank, squats, situps, curls with light weights.
  For these I set the phone timer for 2 minutes and do them for that long.
  Then I can daydream during the exercise.
  I quite enjoy these.

I pick 2 exercises every day and do them.
It's different every day so the muscles get plenty of breaks.
I won't bulk up from these but it makes me feel much better about myself.
My mood is better for the day.
And I no longer feel unfit or get out of breath from a bit of stair climbing.

If I feel unmotivated, sad, or otherwise constrained (for example while traveling) then I only do one set only, for example squat hold because I can do that anywhere, even in the toilet.
Rule: never break the habit.
No zero days.
If it's the end of the day and I'm in bed, I can still do some situps.
This way the habit stays in my subconscious and the momentum keeps me going.
The habit gets easier over time.
I don't even think about it much.
