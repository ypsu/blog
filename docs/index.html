<p>
welcome to notech.ie! i noticed that these days i am surrounded with fancy
technology. however over time i thought a lot and realized that that all this
unnecessary technology and general complexity around is making me unhappy. i
became a luddite to keep my sanity. sysadmin at day, technophobic at night. it
is not that i think technology is bad for humanity, i just have a bad personal
relationship with it. i need to vent about this someplace so i bought this
corner of the internet for myself to do so. among other things i loathe html,
css, capital letters so the content on this site is served as plainly as
possible in all lowercase. this way i can avoid dealing with all that baloney
just to jot some thoughts down. if for some reason you want to talk to me, write
an email to flubber at notech.ie.
</p>

<p>
fun fact: this site is available through the gopher protocol as well. if you do
not want to use the browser to read this, just use netcat on a linux:
</p>

<pre>
 nc notech.ie 70 &lt;&lt;&lt; /about
</pre>

<p>
github.com/ypsu/notech hosts the backup and history of this blog.

the problem with plain text is that it does not really have a standard on how to
rewrap it to other column sizes. i do not mind this, i just assume 80 columns as
the universal width. however that does not play nice with kindle. it wraps
plaintext quite awfully. there is not much it can do with plaintext. it can do a
much better job with html. i quite dislike html but it is a widely used and
supported format so it will do for this purpose. i have the full contents of
this blog available in html at html.notech.ie. i host this on a separate server
(github) because my little server only works for small, &lt;100k byte long files.
this limitation prevents me from creating overly long documents.
</p>

<p>
html.notech.ie contains the whole blog on one large site with minimal formatting
so it is very easy to either open on kindle&apos;s browser or just download and
convert it to a .mobi file. i wish more blogs and sites would allow easy binge
reading.
</p>

<p>
i also publish the last 4 articles to notech.ie/latest so followers can still
catch up in html without downloading everything on every visit. since this
always fits my arbitrary &lt;100k byte length limit, i am happy to host it myself.
</p>

<p>
note that i do not limit document width in the generated html because i think
that is rude. making the text narrower is always easier. i can make the browser
window narrower, use firefox&apos;s responsive design mode or its reading view, or
just open the javascript console and enter &quot;document.body.style.width =
&apos;30em&apos;;&quot;. making a document wider needs a phd in css.
</p>

<h2 id="simulation">simulation</h2>
<p>
when i was a little kid, i always wondered where the christmas gifts come from.
people told me that jesus puts all the presents under the christmas tree. since
the gifts were there and i was not a particularly bright person (still not), i
accepted this explanation. they also told me that a god created the world and
that i will live forever in the heaven or hell after i die. but then i noticed
that one of toys i got was not new. so i pestered my parents about it and they
admitted that the gifts do not come from jesus but from them. so then i
questioned people about the rest of the story and most of them admitted that it
is just a story, it is not something that i can verify with my own eyes. i have
to &quot;believe&quot;. ummm. right. i think i will look around first, thanks.
</p>

<p>
so then i read about the people who claim that there is absolutely nothing after
death. there are no supernatural beings, there are no souls. we are just simple
biological meatbags that completely vanish after their expiration. there is not
much point to life other than just to &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;enjoy&quot; it while it
lasts. i will not get another change. there is nothing happening after death,
just like nothing happened before birth.
</p>

<p>
i found this quite an agreeable position. it is quite practical, its explanation
does not seem to require concepts that we cannot experience. however since i
went through one big disillusion before, i was trying to be more open minded
just in case i see even more convincing newer theories. however as i was reading
discussions around the topic, this biological-only camp seemed just as convinced
about their truth as their religious counterparts. i understand that believing
in mystical entities is not practical but flat out stating that things cannot
possibly exist seemed presumptuous. so i kept a &quot;i do not know&quot; stance instead.
</p>

<p>
later i came across the simulation argument. it says that assuming a
civilization can reach the technological point where it can run complex
simulations, it is possible that it has already happened. if one civilization
can reach it then probably many others can too. if that is the case then there
are many simulations running in the world. in fact it is quite likely that most
living organisms are in a simulation, including us.
</p>

<p>
i quite liked this train of thought. it does not try to explain what the world
is, it just a shows one possibility. it just says there we cannot be sure but
there is a chance that this is happening. at this point this did not look any
more practical than the complete denial of supernaturalism but the idea was
nevertheless interesting.
</p>

<p>
so i began thinking about simulations in general. how would i implement them?
how would i play in them? thinking like this opened my eyes. this simulation
assumption actually gives me practical ways on how to approach the &quot;what is the
meaning of life&quot;, &quot;what is the point&quot;, &quot;how should i live my life&quot; sort of
questions. all i need to do is just to apply my thoughts about the
implementation and simulation playing to this simulation (my life). so true or
not, it is practical for me.
</p>

<p>
one could argue that religion is also practical and beneficial. in fact it is
quite likely if we consider it from evolutionary standpoint. there are many
religions in the world. the ones that are overly harmful probably died out and
the ones that survived probably contain many beneficial practices. the problem
is that to pick up a religion&apos;s practices, one also has to pick up its way of
thinking which is usually &quot;stop thinking&quot;. but i quite like some of the ideas
religion has like
</p>

<ul><li>
  meetings: regular ritualistic meetings with the same folks helps people avoid
  isolation and folks can keep up with or watch over their community,
</li><li>
  rituals: sometimes waking up seems pointless but rituals or habits motivate
  people to not stop living,
</li><li>
  festives: rather than keeping every day gray these bring some variety into
  people&apos;s lives,
</li><li>
  legends: these build up some folklore, a shared history, something to talk
  about,
</li><li>
  afterlife: just something to motivate folks to be good to each other,
</li><li>
  fasting: i see more and more articles that this is actually quite beneficial,
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and probably more. however i think all this is achievable without the need to
stop thinking and blindly believing in mystical stories.
</p>

<p>
my foray into the simulation hypothesis will not rise to as mature way of life
as a religion but at least it is based on logic that i agree with. and
eventually little by little i can build up a similarly practical life based on
the observations from this hypothesis. so let me talk aobut what implications i
found from this.
</p>

<p>
the first way i think about the simulation hypothesis is how would i implement
it. there are two main ways to do it: i can make it static or i can make it
interactive.
</p>

<p>
by static simulation i mean something like a movie. the story is given, i can
replay it many times, the same thing happens every time. perhaps i can replay
the same events from a different person&apos;s perspective. i write a story i like
then i can &quot;join and live through&quot; the characters. this assumption leads to
observations like &quot;there is no free will&quot;, &quot;everybody has an importance&quot; or
&quot;there will be a grand ending&quot;.
</p>

<p>
by interactive simulation i mean something like a video game. there is no real
story given. all i have is this big sandbox where everybody is to themselves.
this leads to observations like &quot;there is not much meaning to all of this&quot; or
&quot;just have fun while it lasts&quot;.
</p>

<p>
my personal take on this is that we live in an interactive simulation. i take
this view solely from practical point of view. if the simulation is like a movie
then it does not matter what i do so i might become unmotivated. however if it
is interactive then what i do matters in the long haul.
</p>

<p>
then i also have to think about how complex the simulation can be. if i had to
implement it, i would probably go with the simplest implementation. this means
earth is the only planet in the entire universe with life on it. i would also
make arbitrary constants that make my implementation simpler like limiting the
maximum speed matter or effects can travel so that the supercomputers simulating
all this have an easier time chomping through all the data.
</p>

<p>
the other way to think about all this is to think about why and how would i
participate in the simulation. similarly i can ask why would i want to watch a
movie or why would i want to play a video game. there are usually two primary
reasons to do either of those. i play because i am bored. it is entirely
possible that the outside world is so boring that i am looking for more
fulfillment in the simulation. if i look at it this way, then i am in this for
the fun. just make sure the fun lasts long. alternatively i might be playing the
game or watching the movie because i want to feel challenged and want to feel
that i overcame the challenges. the world is full of challenges. it is up to me
take a chunk of it and complete them.
</p>

<p>
my take is on that i play this because i am bored in the outside world. compare
single and multiplayer games. in single player games there is a challenge i have
to overcome. however if i do not follow the game&apos;s campaign, the game does not
progress. also note that the characters in the game have usually different
roles, each helping me towards the goal or being the challenge i have to
overcome. the single player games usually have a beginning and end. once i
overcome the challenge, the game loses its appeal. on the other hand in
multiplayer games i usually play with other players. most challenges in
multiplayer games would be meaningless without the other players. i play the
game with others, me playing the game makes the game in some sense. most players
have the same roles and the game does not lose its appeal over time as long as
the player base is good. i play this game because it is fun, which means not
playing the game is a more boring activity.
</p>

<p>
the world i observe feels more like the multiplayer game where each player plays
for themselves rather than the single player game where each other entity is
there only for me. this is why i think that i am here out of boredom.
</p>

<p>
my biggest epiphany came when i considered to look at how i watch movies or play
video games. would it be a fun movie if the movie consisted of just other people
watching movies? or would it be fun if the video game consisted of playing other
video games? let me phrase it this way. suppose i want to play a shooter game.
in the shooter game i find an arcade machine on which i can play, say, pacman.
would i play pacman on it? for a few minutes, sure. but would i invest a lot of
time into playing pacman? if i like pacman so much, why not play a game that is
pacman and therefore is probably better designed? why would i invest a large
chunk of resources into a complex simulation in which i play a simpler
simulation?
</p>

<p>
this led me to my first practical observation: watching movies or playing
videogames is silly! to play now and then is fine but i must avoid sinking hours
daily into these activities.
</p>

<p>
and then many other observations started pouring in.
</p>

<p>
if this is a multiplayer game for fun, i should not ruin the game for others. in
fact, it is best if i can improve it for others. i should make the world a
better place to live in. ugh, tough order. but not ruining the game is a good
start.
</p>

<p>
if i am playing a multiplayer game then it is the other players that make the
game fun. it means that i am meant to live among others. i am meant to interact
with others.
</p>

<p>
if i am in this complex simulation with all these rich sensors in my body, i am
probably meant to use them. for instance in person interaction and communication
always feels richer thanks to all these sensors than the low bandwidth messaging
or videochat solutions. messaging is very good for coordination but i should not
use it to maintain long distance relationships. i should build new ones so that
i can the use the rich communication channel again.
</p>

<p>
players come and go. i should not stress too much about particular players. if a
player goes away forever, i shall seek other players to have fun with.
</p>

<p>
i should not stress too much about the past or lost opportunities. i can
probably always respawn and play again if i did not feel fully satisfied.
</p>

<p>
there is no end goal other than being happy. once i reach the point where we can
sustain ourselves with little work indefinitely, i should free up any unneeded
resources we use (e.g. a job) and help others achieve a similar state. with this
hypothesis, it is the other people rather than one&apos;s material possessions that
makes one happy.
</p>

<p>
and i could probably go on. but the general gist is that based on that the
meaning of life for me is to be happy, achieve happiness through personal
relationships, and help others be happy. this is a generally well accepted
meaning to life. but the nice thing about this is that i do not need to blindly
accept this because people in authority told me so. i devised this conclusion
from concepts i am familiar with via reasoning that i agree with. it does not
really matter if simulation hypothesis is true or not, it is a mental tool for
me that helps me make sense of the world. if i cannot understand something in
the world, i can use this tool to ask myself how and why would i implement such
a thing. sometimes things make a little more sense when looked that way. so
therefore my current stance about world is &quot;we probably live in a simulation&quot;
just because it is a practical assumption.
</p>

<h2 id="uppercase">uppercase</h2>
<p>
why are there two glyphs for each english letter? why are there bunch of random
rules to decide which glyph to use in various situations? i honestly have no
idea. i suspect this might have been their history:
</p>

<ul><li>
  people chisel into stone tablets. only long straight strokes are practical so
  people use uppercase. only uppercase letters exist at this point.
</li><li>
  people start writing with hands. cursive scripts are much easier on the hand
  so people start rounding the letters. eventually these become the lowercase
  letters.
</li><li>
  to make books look fancy, the first letter on each page is a huge ass old
  style uppercase letter.
</li><li>
  everyone wants to look fancy, everyone makes the first letter old style
  uppercase letter.
</li><li>
  now every sentence starts with an uppercase.
</li><li>
  now every name starts with an uppercase.
</li><li>
  world implodes due to this insanity (not happened yet but soon will).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this is nonsense. there is zero difference how you pronounce uppercase letters
versus lowercase letters therefore there should not be two separate cases. &quot;oh
but it helps me find the sentence&apos;s start&quot;. boohoo. you will get used to it.
that is why punctuation exists. if uppercase letters would not exist and
somebody would want to invent it, people would laugh them off. say i invent a
middle case with completely different glyphs for each letter and the rule is to
use middle case at the end of sentences or names. does that sound ridiculous?
well, uppercase sounds just as ridiculous to me. most non-western languages do
not have this idiocracy.
</p>

<p>
why keep lowercase instead of uppercase? because lowercase is much easier on
eyes. it has larger variety in height. you see a word like &quot;apple&quot; and you can
see two spikes down before the middle and one spike up after the middle. chances
are you can still better guess the word after applying extreme blur levels
compared to its uppercase version where all letters have the same size.
</p>

<p>
and just imagine how significantly easier writing would become. no more effort
wasted about thinking or discussing the capitalization of titles, names, lists
and so on. less effort typing the uppercase letters. less computer logic to
compare words. if you want to make the world a better place then stop using
uppercase letters. please spread the word to make this revolution reach a
critical mass.
</p>

<h2 id="autocompletion">autocompletion</h2>
<p>
there are two sorts of autocompletion. the first is where the autocompletion
just lists all possible syntaxically correct options, like path completion for
the cd command in bash. the other autocompletion is where a black box tells me
the most likely ending for whatever i am typing. over time i learned to loathe
both.
</p>

<p>
syntax completion is usually quite straightforward, predictable and generally
understood how it works. however it is often flaky and invoking the completion
then choosing the right option takes more time than what it would have taken if
i just typed in the option myself completely. it also allows complexity to stay,
it does not intrinsically motivate me to fix my environment such that
autocompletion is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
let me explain through the path completion example. suppose i have a bash open,
i am in a network file system directory with many files in it. i press tab tab.
now bash has to stat every file and the whole shell just locks up. when the
autocompletion is not instant, it is super annoying. do i just wait longer or
shall i try to kill the botched autocomplete or shall i type further and hope
for the best? all i wanted to spare typing 2 keyspresses and now i am involved
in a complex decision making process. the other issue is when i press
autocomplete too early, i get many choices and now i find myself reading through
all the choices and have to make a choice whether to continue typing or take the
first suggestion. again, in most cases i already know what i want and i could
have finished typing but now instead of doing that i am reading words on the
screen, eating up precious cache space in my small memory. the third problem is
that if i have deeply nested directory hierarchies, i just keep tabbing through
them. i never actually take action to fix them. &quot;it is not so bad&quot; i keep
telling myself.
</p>

<p>
so without syntax or path autocompletion, my editor will never lock up. i will
never need to think about whether to wait for autocompletion or not. no more
pondering whether i should debug or improve the autocompletion or not. no more
contemplation about the ideal autocompletion system. i just type the identifiers
naturally. the screen is not jumping around with random unrelated information
while i type. the only thing appearing is what i typed in, leading to a very
distraction free experience. this is a blessing since have a very easily
distractible personality. the other nice thing is that if i am forced to type in
long identifiers or deep path hierarchies regularly, i will have some motivation
to refactor the environment or structure so that such typing is unnecessary.
basically no autocompletion intrinsically helps me maintain simplicity in my
projects.
</p>

<p>
so these days i do not use any sort autocompletion. i even disabled path
completion in bash. it was very odd at first. but eventually i got used to and i
no longer miss autocompletion. and whenever people are complaining about an
autocompletion failure, i just smirk under my nose, and feel happy that i no
longer have such problems.
</p>

<p>
the other type of autocompletion is this machine learning based &quot;let me finish
what you started&quot; sort of machinery. basically it wants to finish my sentences
instead of letting me do so. i find this very misguided. i take pride that i am
able to formulate full sentences without external help. i do not want help in
writing. i do not use smartphones or other toys so i always have the ability to
comfortably type in any word or sentence i wish. if i do not type the words
myself, i do not learn how to spell them correctly. i am a kinesthetic learner.
if i do not practice something, i do not learn. similarly if the computer
finishes my thoughts, it is much harder for me to think. if i do not need to
think then why am i even here? thinking and formulating full sentences is fun
for me, i do not want computers to take that away. the implementation is usually
also quite distracting. say i start typing a list of keywords i am interested in
and then the search box starts suggesting others. the problem with this is that
sometimes the suggested keyword has absolutely zero relevance to my query, yet i
find it interesting so i am likely to search for that instead of what i
originally wanted. basically the search box is taking away control of my
interests and telling me what to look for instead. i am weak against temptations
so i find it manipulative if things take advantage of this. so i do not want
this either. i made sure that i see no completion on my machine when i use it. i
can think and type for myself, thank you very much.
</p>

<h2 id="history">history</h2>
<p>
tracking every minute detail of my daily failings is pointless. i am talking
about collecting the history of every command i execute in bash, every url i
visit in a browser, or every gps coordinate i ever visited. this is a lot of
data. most of it is just noise. whenever i wanted to look up some data in
history, it actually took very long time browsing through all the data and
sometimes i did not find what i was seeking. i found it is actually more
efficient to reconstruct the command or url from scratch. it also helps me
exercise my memory so it dwindles away slower. i often relied on bash history to
find the right parameterization for a command i remembered using. without
history i cannot do this. but i am better off this way. i am no longer relying
on an external, private, somewhat volatile database to interact with the
computers. it forces me to familiarize with the documentation. if that is
lacking, it motivates me to improve said documentation. better documentation
makes the environment nicer for others too. since i have to type out the
arguments myself, i get more acquainted with the commands themselves from which
i often pick up clever, out of the box ideas. in the urls&apos; case it forces to
learn the url structure of the websites, and to come up with succinct urls for
my own work. sharing urls is very easy and natural when urls are sane.
</p>

<p>
maintaining this history database is also quite the pain. i am not comfortable
keeping my bash, browsing or gps history in some non-personal device or an
external device not encrypted by me. when i use multiple computers, shells,
browsers then maintaining this history becomes quite complicated. i value my
sanity so i would need elaborate bash hacks to keep the history in sync across
computers. perhaps i would consider even more elaborate hacks if i wanted to
inject new history into an already running bash process. or when i use multiple
browsers then they have separate histories and i usually do not remember what
history is in which browser. i could probably set up some sort of elaborate
syncing scheme between them too if i would care enough.
</p>

<p>
the history database might not contain everything. it will not contain entries
from my incognito browsing. i might be remembering that i visited a website,
then i would try to look it up in the history but i will not find there. i would
spend a lot of time before i would realize i used incognito so the history will
not have it. the bash process can also suddenly die and lose precious history in
it which i would then feel bad about.
</p>

<p>
the history does not have good availability guarantees. i might accidentally
truncate all my bash history. i would then feel very sad. or i might decide that
i want to use a different computer and now the history is gone and i have hard
time using it. or if i store my history on a network service, my workflow
depends on that network being available. it is just another unnecessary
dependency.
</p>

<p>
keeping all the history slows down the application. bash now needs to read in
all history before it shows its prompt. not only i have a slower startup, but
now i also have less memory available for other work too. bash and the browsers
need to keep some history in the memory too to keep lookups fast. and in bash&apos;s
case it probably does not even share history between the processes so i would be
paying this cost multiple times.
</p>

<p>
the history might have chance of leaking. suppose somebody sits down to my
computer and starts browsing. now they could easily see all my naughty sites i
visit or the naughty data i have. if it is on a networked service, then there is
a chance that there will be a global leak at some point and then everybody will
have access to everybody else&apos;s history. that might contain some things i would
not be comfortable with others seeing.
</p>

<p>
and do not even get me started on the idea of tracking gps location history.
that is wrong on so many levels that i will not even bother trying to explain
it. i do not use gps nor smartphones so i do not have this problem. but i
suspect smartphones have this feature enabled by default. it is just something
to be aware of. i understand that my carrier probably tracks my brick phone&apos;s
whereabouts but at least i do not have to worry that 7 independent services also
tracking it via their preinstalled spyware.
</p>

<p>
so i stopped caring about my tracking my history. i find that this leads to much
healthier practices, better memory, less work and less worrying about losing or
leaking said history. therefore i disabled history where i could: bash and the
browsers. note that i still keep per session history in bash because otherwise
correcting typos in commands would be super annoying. but i never write out the
history to disk. i actually use a raspberry pi as my primary hobby computer so i
get less wear on my sd disks this way which is a nice plus. besides, forgetting
is a feature. if i forget something, then 99% of the cases it is a good
riddance. no need to carry on the past forever.
</p>

<h2 id="simplicity">simplicity</h2>
<p>
i really dislike maintaining and debugging complex systems. i suspect nobody
likes them. yet no matter how hard people try, we always end up in a mess.
however i do not think this has to be the case. we should be able to create
simple systems. all we need is a set of healthy practices and an agreement from
all parties participating in the system that we want to avoid ending up in a
complex system. everything starts simple but it is actually quite hard to keep a
system simple especially if said system grows in number of features, components
or participants. but here is one of the key observations: growth is what starts
making systems complex. usually growth results in weird new interactions between
the system&apos;s components. the system&apos;s original design might not be a good fit
for the new, larger usecase.
</p>

<p>
so here is the key lesson from that observation. if everything starts out simple
but then growth makes systems complex then all we need to do is stop the growth.
easier said than done. this is especially hard if the sole goal of our system is
to replace other more complex systems. but if we allow growth, our system will
grow into the same complex system we were trying to replace. my take from this
is that we ought not to replace existing systems with new systems entirely. in
fact the new system should explicitly forbid to grow into the same proportions
as the larger system.
</p>

<p>
one way to achieve growth limitation is to set explicit limits for the features
in the system. when a limit is reached then do not just bump the limit but
either move the misfit component out of the system or restructure said component
so that it works in the system. growth in such a system is going to be super
frustrating. but it is that growth that the system is set up to prevent. people
usually do not like systems that make them frustrated so such system cannot
become a popular system. that is the downside. on the other hand the
participants who accept the limits willingly will stay happy because they will
not get bogged down with all the unnecessary complexity.
</p>

<p>
allow me to demonstrate these concepts with an example. my ideal computing
environment is where every component of the stack from the operating system to
all the user space applications is super simple, easily understandable,
reviewable, perhaps tweakable. this environment might not as efficient as a hand
optimized mainstream stack but i would not mind that because i can then
understand my tools with less expertise. it would be easier to customize the
system to my usecase.
</p>

<p>
one component of this stack would be the text editor. i could decide on its
implementation. i could use fancy linked lists to manipulate large chunks of
text efficiently. or i could impose terrible limits on my text. i could say this
editor will not support lines longer than 100 columns and 10_000 lines. such
draconian limits would significantly simplify the implementation because i will
no longer need to think about efficient ways to handle large files or files with
long lines. using such editor will be quite terrible too. most people would hate
these arbitrary limitations. i would not mind though. i suspect there would be a
handful of other people who would also embrace this. first of all, people can
get used to limitations. early computers had tiny amounts of memory, yet most
things still worked out finely. secondly, if my system has an arbitrary limit of
100 columns per line, then writing other tools are much easier too. they do not
need to have complex logic to handle arbitrary length strings or concern about
algorithms that do not scale well to long strings. the simplicity of this
arbitrary constraint cascades through the whole system.
</p>

<p>
arbitrary limits or constraints are not only useful to keep the system simple.
they force me to become creative. suppose i am writing some complex software. i
keep writing the whole shebang into one file and after some time i reach the
10_000 line mark. on a contemporary system i do not even notice that this
happened. however in this limited system i suddenly become painfully aware that
i hit the system&apos;s limit. i am now forced to step back and perhaps split my
project into smaller modules at that stage. at that line count that is probably
a good idea anyways. so the constraints keep me on my toes and keep my activity
in check. these constraints are not just something to keep some parts of the
system&apos;s implementation easy but also to signal to the system&apos;s components what
are the expected behavior and resource usage they have to work with. keeping the
overall system simple is not something to graze over though. it is no
coincidence that even these days people still make commodore or amiga demos just
because working in a limited, fully learnable environment is so refreshing.
</p>

<p>
but note that if i am paid to write software for others, i am often not terribly
excited about the projects i am supposed to do. if i run into some frustration
stemming from arbitrary constraints of a tool, i might be tempted to simply
switch to a tool that does not have said limitation. the resource costs,
inefficiencies, the bugs of that tool or the complexity debt i add due to using
a more complex tool is not my problem, my employer can pay others to deal with
it. and this is actually nice because this way my employer can pay others to
make faster and larger computer chips or ready software bundled with many
features and thus the world does not stop progressing. though note that if i am
solely on the hook for said tool then i would start looking into refactoring my
use of the tool instead.
</p>

<p>
however in my hobby environment i really the idea of simplicity stemming from a
constrained environment. so when i am writing my little tools in c i do not shy
away from just using a few large arrays and returning an error if i try to use
them on a larger input. this way they do not become slower over time as the
input grows unboundedly. i know the input limits at the time of writing so every
decision i made in its code is based on that assumption. if the input outgrows
my tool, i usually need to rearchitect my tool anyways. i usually do not know in
which dimension will my tool grow. does my text editor need to handle longer
lines or more lines? making the tool scale in every dimension makes its code
super complicated. at first i will assume no scalability and then if the need
really arises, i might think a little bit about it.
</p>

<p>
it is not just my computing environment i like simplicity and predictability.
this is also why i do not own a smartphone. it is such a complicated device. but
everything can be done on a desktop computer too. with a desktop computer i am
physically constrained to be in front of the computer to use it. i actually like
this constraint otherwise i might just keep checking my smartphone all the time,
even when i would be better off just looking at the nature or listen to the
chatter of others. another example would be the fact that i very much dislike
spending money which has many ramifications. for instance i try to avoid
spending money on transportation and therefore i walk everywhere if i can. at
the time of writing this my commute to work takes 1 hour by walking. this
arbitrary constraint of being a cheapskate actually keeps me somewhat fit and
gives me 2 hours daily just to meditate and think things through. my life gets
simpler and i actually feel happier because of the workarounds i need to do due
to these voluntary limitations. and this is why i like voluntary constraints.
</p>

<h2 id="markup">markup</h2>
<p>
i hate most markup languages because of their feature creep. it all started with
html. it is the most popular markup language since most web is in that format. i
am not sure if it was ever meant for humans to write though. probably not.
however it is not so bad if you do so and only use the basic features. but most
sites i visit generate their html from other sources of truth so browsing the
internet without a html parser is impossible. this is quite sad though. i think
its original goal was to mark up plaintext document with &quot;links&quot; and that is why
it was called hypertext markup language. and while at it they added some extra
markup to separate individual paragraphs and to insert headings, emphasis,
simple lists, tables and images. then based on the capabilities and the settings
of the client&apos;s computer, a browser rendered the document as nice as it could.
</p>

<p>
but html today is not what it used to be. i do not consider it as a markup
language anymore. i consider it as a file format to render resizable &quot;content&quot;
in a browser. it is a programming language. as such i am no longer in control
how the computer renders the document for me. even worse, some sites go as
moronic as to use their own crappy font from the internet rather than the fonts
i specifically set. i have preference for specific fonts and i prefer to read in
those. or set a maximum width for their document. have these people not
considered that there exist people on this planet that are able to read more
than 2 words per line? making lines shorter is easy since i can just make the
browser window smaller or go into the browser&apos;s reader mode. making lines longer
is much trickier. oh, i could disable css. but then often the document becomes
tangled in the sense that all the content and non-content bits are interspersed
in one giant blob of text. website owners really should really consider ensuring
that their site still works without css and javascript. basically make sure the
site is browsable in the links terminal browser.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand crappy site usually also means crappy content. so if the site
tries to force a specific &quot;viewing experience&quot; then chances are it is trying to
compensate for low quality content that i would not really want to read if it
were to presented in, say, plaintext format. therefore i rather avoid such
websites. visiting fancy websites actually reminds me that i probably should be
doing something better instead. so thanks for doing that.
</p>

<p>
the other markup popular markup language is markdown. it started out simple and
with the explicit goal that the plaintext version of the document remains just
as readable. it added a little bit too many features in my opinion though. but
that would not have been too much of a problem had it stayed that way. but when
i look at the newest versions it is utterly nonsensical. for instance i open the
commonmark&apos;s specification and i am presented gazillions of features and then
long discussion about all the corner cases of those misdesigned features. and i
suspect it will get much worse over time. when a person starts using all those
fancy features it is again a smell that the author is spending way too much time
on the presentation which suggest that the underlying content might not be as
interesting as they wanted it to be.
</p>

<p>
really there should be only a handful of features needed. all the markup
language for simple documents is supposed to do is to make it resizeable so the
readers can read it on various devices with various font sizes. here is the list
of features that ought to be enough for everyone:
</p>

<ul><li>
  headings: this allows generating table of contents and allows creating anchors
  for specific sections. no more than 2 levels though excluding the document&apos;s
  title.
</li><li>
  lists: unordered only. lists are handy organization tool. usually people
  prefer the text to be indented so that it is easy to skip to the next entry in
  the list visually. this changes the resizing logic a little bit and this is
  why needs to be a first class element.
</li><li>
  preformatted content: this section would look exactly the same in the rendered
  document as it looks in the source with monospace fonts. very handy for tables
  or code blocks. usually this is only needed in technical documents. most text
  would be fine without this.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and this is all what is needed. stop at that and i am happy. those features are
quite straightforward to implement and do not have corner cases. in fact this
website is written in a markup language that only uses those features. look at
my /htmlize article to see how this site gets transformed into a nice html page
in a few lines of awk code. it does not support headings though because i just
use different files to organize different sections. the generator creates the
headings based on the filenames.
</p>

<p>
and here is what is not needed in a markup language for simple documents:
</p>

<ul><li>
  hard line breaks: just use lists or preformatted content.
</li><li>
  emphasis: just use punctuation marks like quotes to emphasize a word or
  sentence. as with all practices, once you get used to this, you will not miss
  the italics.
</li><li>
  bold, underline: these create a very jarring effect on the text. bolded words
  pulls my eyes towards themselves and that makes reading the surrounding text
  harder. please do not make your text harder to read.
</li><li>
  tables: there is no nice way to express this. just use the preformatted
  content for tables. if you have trouble editing tables in plaintext then
  either simplify your tables or use a text editor which can edit plaintext
  tables.
</li><li>
  ordered lists: just use unordered lists and begin each entry with the entry&apos;s
  number of other identifier used to signify the order. usually when you number
  something, you do so so that you can refer to entries by number later on. such
  references get out of date very quickly if you add a new step. therefore
  rather than using numbers for reference, you could use some sort of
  identifiers too. e.g. in the 12 step plan instead of writing &quot;- 5. admit to
  yourself ...&quot; you would write &quot;- confession: admit to yourself ...&quot;. then
  instead of referring to &quot;the 5. step&quot;, you refer to &quot;the confession step&quot;. the
  latter style needs more creativity but it turns out to be more memorable.
  note: in an earlier version of this document i did support ordered lists. then
  i realized i never used them and that unordered lists can be used to emulate
  them so i decided i do not need the complexity of the ordered lists either.
</li><li>
  paragraphs in lists: if your content in the list is so long that you need
  several paraphraphs then it is best that you do not organize the content into
  lists but into paragraphs.
</li><li>
  lists in lists: please avoid doing this. nested structures are quite hard to
  follow. just be creative and organize differently. use preformatted content if
  you really need a specific structure.
</li><li>
  links: i do not like the fact when the document tries to hide what it is
  pointing at. i much prefer to see the naked links. so just write out the link
  in its entirety. then the document renderer can decide to render these bits as
  links. the markup language does not need any special support for this. this
  also requires for the writer to simplify the link so that it remains short and
  sweet. short links help the reader understand where the link points to. but do
  not use url shortening services, that is cheating. in general, avoid writing
  in a way that requires links or even footnotes. it makes reading much harder
  because the reader is now tempted to check out the link rather than just
  simply continue reading. i am very easily distracted so reading a document
  with many links or footnotes ruins the experience. just have a &quot;further
  references&quot; section at the end of the document for the links with a short
  summary what each link is about.
</li><li>
  footnotes: footnotes are quite distracting because of the temptation of
  checking them out and then navigating back and forth in the document. but in
  some cases they are unavoidable, like in wikipedia&apos;s case where you want to
  reference the source of all claims. however these do not really need to part
  of the markup either. you can just use, say, bracketed identifiers like
  [myref] and then have a references section at the end of the document which
  expand these references. the document renderer does not need to add support
  for this either. if you are curious about a reference, you can just search for
  &quot;[myref]&quot; in the reference section and you can read it. in fact to do not make
  navigating references easier than that because otherwise writers are tempted
  to use them to add interesting footnotes rather than incorporating those bits
  into the main document. for footnotes i recommend using parenthetical comments
  instead.
</li><li>
  blockquotes: just use quotation marks. if you have a longer section that you
  want to indent, you can always a single element long list. it is a bit weird
  but just as effective and simplifies both the format and renderer because they
  do not have to support yet another feature.
</li><li>
  images: most documents do not need images. but sometimes an image indeed adds
  a lot of value to a document. in plaintext all you can do is to provide a link
  to the image. so you can use that. maybe i would accept a notation where you
  prepend the url with a &quot;!&quot; to signify that the renderer should inline the
  image. but never use this to embed videos or gifs. only add static images. i
  am incapable of reading text if there is any movement on my screen.
</li><li>
  scripts: if your document needs scripts then it is not really a plain document
  but rather a tool or an application. probably it is not meant for simple
  consumption but interaction. e.g. if you add some sharing or commenting widget
  then you are probably not trying to teach or entertain people but rather you
  are trying to garner some reaction and perhaps sell something. you are in some
  shady business then. people should probably avoid your document. if you are
  considering enabling comments then it is better to go to online forums and
  make your posts there instead. such places are better suited for discussions.
  or just have your readers send feedback privately. then you can do a summary
  post with the feedback and your response integrated into the text. the quality
  of your site remains higher and your readers have an easier way to keep up
  with you.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if somebody has something interesting to say, they do not need formatting. they
can just tell it plainly. if a text is trying to explain a complex concept,
fancy formatting will not make it easier. it will just give it an appearance of
simplicity but not actually help. i recommend improving the text instead so that
it explains the concept more vividly or with more examples.
</p>

<p>
as for my markup the rules are simple. the document is considered in paragraphs
where paragraphs are separated with empty lines. the paragraph&apos;s first line
determines what sort of paragraph it will be. if it begins with space, i wrap
the whole thing into a &lt;pre&gt;. if it begins with a &quot;- &quot;, i treat is as an
unordered list and each line starting with &quot;- &quot; starts another element. if none
of the above matches, i wrap the paragraph into an ordinary &lt;p&gt; tag. and that is
all there is. no corner cases, no complicated implementation needed. if i cannot
express something with the above rules then that just means i am not challenging
myself enough. i then go and think hard and come up with a way that can fit
those rules. the result is then much simpler and i am then usually more pleased
with it and thus i am happier. simple, constraining rules lead to better
documents.
</p>

<p>
example in case you are viewing this in the html version:
</p>

<pre>
 test paragraph
</pre>

<pre>
 - unordered list
   with multiple lines
 - and entries
</pre>

<pre>
 - 1. simulated ordered list
 - 2. entry two
</pre>

<pre>
  pre
     formatted
               content
</pre>

<pre>
  table example:
</pre>

<pre>
   id |   name | age |  weight
   ---+--------+-----+--------
   13 |  james |  37 |   88 kg
   27 | sophia |  42 |   70 kg
   39 |   john |  30 |  123 kg
</pre>

<p>
gets translated to this:
</p>

<p>
test paragraph
</p>

<ul><li>
  unordered list
  with multiple lines
</li><li>
  and entries
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  1. simulated ordered list
</li><li>
  2. entry two
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
 pre
    formatted
              content
</pre>

<pre>
 table example:
</pre>

<pre>
  id |   name | age |  weight
  ---+--------+-----+--------
  13 |  james |  37 |   88 kg
  27 | sophia |  42 |   70 kg
  39 |   john |  30 |  123 kg
</pre>

<p>
and that demonstrated all the features i need and support. it is not necessary
the nicest but it is functional enough for me.
</p>

<h2 id="gps">gps</h2>
<p>
the global positioning system is a marvel of human engineering, no doubt at
that. however i really wish it would not exist. my personal beef with the gps is
sucks the fun out of the exploration. i owned a smartphone for about a year
before i threw it away so i do have some experience with gps and navigation. in
those days whenever i wanted to go to any place, i just simply put in the
destination into the device and then followed the path it devised. rather than
looking up and learning about my environment, i was looking down to my phone,
following the arrow and only looked up occasionally to check which street i have
to turn onto. basically i felt that my phone reduced me to a mindless drone. i
was completely fine before the gps, never felt that i was missing it but after
the phone ditch event i felt some withdrawal effect from it. i was even a bit
afraid to venture outside just because i might get lost. however i feel much
happier without it. whenever i want to go to a place i have not been yet, i have
to plan ahead. i have to study the map. i have to learn about large landmarks
that can guide my path. i can perhaps walk through the path virtually through a
street view application. i even draw myself a minimap just in case i do not
remember all the details. then i can execute the journey. during the journey i
am very attentive to my environment. i am sort of in the csíkszentmihályi like
flow where my mind is quietly alert and focused on one thing. i am also very
confident because i know what i expect at every corner. and when i successfully
get to my journey i am quite happy that i planned well and managed to execute
that plan successfully. or maybe i feel happy because of the flow state i was in
for long time. so having no gps, makes my life more fun.
</p>

<p>
okay so i do not need gps but then why do i say it should not even exist? my
problem is that i do know that it is very easy to get hooked on it. once hooked
it is very hard to imagine life without it. people will forget that there are
others who do not have access to gps devices. they will not learn to give
directions in an effective way. they will not create landmarks that simplify
navigation. so my problem is that if society gets overly dependent on gps then
that society will be harder to navigate through without the gps because there
will be no intrinsic motivation to make it simple. basically it will make the
towns and other places less accessible.
</p>

<p>
it even ruins videogames. when i play an open world game, it usually has some
sort of waypoint system so i am just reduced to mindlessly following the
waypoint there too. i do not even look at all the nice scenes the game artists
created for me to enjoy. there is no exploration required. sure, i could turn
off the navigation system but then the game becomes unplayable because the
quests in the game do not fully explain the destination and often there is no
good way to look up a route to the destination and then following that route
without constantly checking the minimap if i am at the place i am supposed to be
or not. this is the effect i was talking about: if people assume that gps
exists, they will not make the place accessible for non-gps users.
</p>

<p>
what i would really wish instead that we would make navigating the world so
simple that a gps is just not needed. suppose a city is organized into a grid of
roads and all the roads are just numbered sequentially. such city would be
boring. but navigating would be super simple because you only need two numbers
to specify a location in it. you can get to that location from any given
location without a map. we should have more like that. so whenever you are
coming up with organization scheme for physical space, try to come up with a way
that does not require navigation tools. make it boring. boring structures make
me happy. please make me happy.
</p>

<p>
and the other problem with universal gps access is the privacy violations it
leads to. large organizations or family might want to know where each member is
at any given moment which usually does not lead to trusting relationships. it is
a silly idea at this point but as technology proliferates it might become more
and more accepted. i might only want to track track my children at first for
their own &quot;safety&quot;. when i fully make terms with that arrangement, i start
thinking of tracking a spouse for their &quot;safety&quot;. then when i get terms with
that arrangement, i might want start tracking more and more family members and
so they want track me in exchange. now everybody is tracking everybody&apos;s
movements. then when governments want to track me for my own own &quot;safety&quot;, i
might not be objecting to it because it is now &quot;normal&quot; to track people. the
situation is horrible at this point. the whole thing escalates in baby steps. it
is better to stop the whole thing in its roots and just live in a way that does
not require the knowledge of one&apos;s position on this planet.
</p>

<h2 id="cars">cars</h2>
<p>
i currently live in a high density area and i learned to despise cars. they are
noisy, inefficient and take up way too much space. there is no place for cars in
inner cities. in fact allowing cars makes a few things more inefficient:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the road and parking infrastructure takes up a lot of space, pushing
  everything even more distant from each other further excarberating the need
  for assisted transportation.
</li><li>
  having cars around slows down walking through the city because i now need to
  wait for the cars to pass whenever i cross streets.
</li><li>
  walking around is more stressing because of the extra noise and awareness
  needed due to the cars. it is much harder to meditate thorough my walk.
</li><li>
  people using cars do not use the public transportation system, so it has less
  chance improving. i often hear people use cars just because they do not like
  the public transportation. but that is just because they do not complain in a
  way that is visible to the public transportation. if they were forced to use
  the service, they would be intrinsically motivated to improve it one way or
  another.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i understand that cars are very practical tools but i believe over the long term
they lead to less efficient cities. and no matter how technologically advanced
we make cars, city dwellers simply should not require cars. but as long as we
allow cars in the cities, a lot of people will not be able to imagine existing
without them. there is a quick way to teach people living without cars though.
just ban all cars except the public transportation, ambulances and other
licensed infrastructure supporting vehicles. perhaps the transition should be
slower than an overnight ban but the endgoal should be the complete ban. maybe
start with a small inner circle for the ban and then slowly extend the ban with
more and more nearby streets every year until after a decade or two the whole
city is car free. this would be a shock for a lot of people. they will get used
to it though and find creative alternatives to whatever things they required
cars for. if a population is forced to evolve, it will evolve. if some people
still miss sitting in cars, they can always go live on the countryside. in
exchange city dwellers can enjoy the efficiencies and benefits of car-free
living.
</p>

<h2 id="money">money</h2>
<p>
money can be practical tool or a cause of big stress in life. it depends how
much you have. have less than what you need then you are causing problems to
yourself, having more than you need then you are making your future self
happier. it would be nicer if the stressing part could go away. does humanity
even need money? as a kid, i did not really need it. my family provided for
everything. even neighbors, relatives often brought gifts or cooked food without
expecting anything in return. i only needed money when i was interacting with
strangers. those strangers did not know me, did not trust me so they needed an
alternative way of giving their goods without feeling bad about themselves. so i
used money there. i guess i could say money is an alternative to trust. it is
not as powerful but still, a simple, one dimensional tool. however i much
preferred the world where things were not reduced to this one dimension. in fact
if i am doing a small favor to someone, i refuse to accept money. that would
just convert this rich sense of trust i acquired into numbers. i would rather
keep the trust than the money. often it is unclear how much money should actions
convert into. even if you assign a value, it changes over time. in the meantime
trust remains constant.
</p>

<p>
i often wonder if such moneyless living is still possible in adulthood. i could
imagine a community of people who live together and agree to share the costs of
living in exchange to not deal with the costs individually. for instance this
group of people might live in a large, multi bedroom shared house with a single,
shared bank account. each person makes a periodic fixed contribution to the bank
account. then the &quot;finance person&quot; pays the bills and rents from that said bank
account. the kitchen is also shared and somebody always fills it up from the
shared bank account. somebody might cook something nice for everybody every day.
maybe group would share bus passes, swimming pool passes or access rights to
other luxuries. the point is that the everyday life does not depend money. the
community members do not need to take their your purse or credit card for rents,
bills or food. that would be quite nice way of living. i am prone to obsess
about spending. i see almost all spending of mine as some sort of inefficiency
and then i start researching and thinking how can i optimize my behavior so that
my spending goes nearer to zero. however if i do not see the bills, i do fine,
blissfully ignorant. the missus already learned that she is better off if she
hides the bills away from me.
</p>

<p>
such shared living does not scale infinitely though. to maintain harmony all
members have to be in sync with each other. they have to have shared values,
house rules and matching personality. maybe it scales up to a dozen of people
tops although i think 4 adults is about the ideal number. finding the right
people is really important. i lived in a few environments and i learned that if
i leave my roommates or living mates up to chance, i will not like it. however
if i pick people i like, it actually enhances my quality of life compared to
living alone or just with a partner. i am really conscious how my words affect
other people so i usually withdraw from conversations just to be safe. i just
listen to others talk. however if i know every person well enough in my
immediate vicinity, i feel more free to talk. so living among friends gives more
opportunity for idle chit chat and other activities which can often be quite
entertaining and fun that i otherwise would not enjoy among strangers or other
acquaintances. the problem is i have not found a good way to easily find the
right people. but that and shared living is a different can of worms.
</p>

<p>
in such arrangements i do not need to think about buying my own food anymore. if
kitchen is always stocked, i can grab some food from there anytime. no more
obsessing about bills. i outsourced my worries to &quot;my tribe&quot;. even if i am
thinking about an expensive purchase of a luxury, like buying a used fixie bike
because i suddenly want to go on a bike tour, i can ask the help of my tribe.
they can verify if this is a sane reason for spending the money, and if so they
can help me with the purchase. they can help negotiate prices, do the financial
transactions and so on. i do not even have to personally think about money. i
trade with trust within my tribe members and on a higher level the tribes trade
with money between each other.
</p>

<p>
maybe a very limited form of the above thoughts could scale up to a larger
community as well. imagine a small but densely occupied town. this town could
have provide cheap free food for whoever that wants it (within limits, e.g. you
have eat everything right at serving). if it serves cheap porridge or just stale
bread every day, that is fine too. maybe it could even have a nearby facility
with clean water and warm rooms. maybe even allow sleeping there. think of
nothing fancy, just mattresses on the floor, rooms perhaps shared with others.
the barest minimum to satisfy the lowest level in the maslow&apos;s hierarchy of
needs. i think keeping up such a facility would not cost a lot of money. most of
the cost would go into the salaries of people running the facility. and probably
nobody would want to use such facilities willingly (i guess i would be an
exception). however having such facility available would mean that no matter
what you have or not have, simple living is available for everyone for free. i
think having free, no questions asked access to the facilities for the basic
needs should be the marker of advanced society. money, trading and access to
luxuries can come after that. i feel just simply giving a lot of money to people
is less effective way to a prosperous civilization. i am not against it, it is
just i think we should not base our pillars of society on money but rather on
infrastructure. once the latter is in place, money can flow freely. let me
demonstrate on a few examples why i think infrastructure would be a better
solution over the long term:
</p>

<ul><li>
  societal integration between the haves and havenots: with free money i think
  this would just decline. from what i can see, rent in cities keeps growing. if
  the poor people do not have access to subsidized housing, they will be forced
  out of the city. thus cities will only house the rich and elites of humanity.
  i think our society should be inclusive and come up with ways that diverse set
  of people can live together, regardless of their income. the people who want
  isolation are the ones who should move out of the cities.
</li><li>
  motivation: if i have to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress and eat the same
  crappy porridge every day, i would be probably intrinsically motivated to do
  something about it. even the slightest extra income can grant me access to a
  luxury. maybe i can get someone give or pay me a decent lunch if i cut their
  grass. maybe then i will be motivated to go back for that extra income. with
  free money, i can decide to save money by keeping my room&apos;s temperature lower
  and then afford a decent lunch every day but otherwise i can still just stay
  at home and do nothing useful, e.g. writing articles like these. the point is
  that the difference between no job and some job is much larger and thus more
  motivating.
</li><li>
  homelessness: in the free money situation people can still stay homeless if
  they for some reason do not have access to money. i might be visiting a
  different city and i might lose my wallet and phone. now i cannot get
  accomodation. in the free infrastructure scenario it is no big deal. i can
  actually decide to go without the wallet because i can food and a bed for free
  anyways.
</li><li>
  stability: the current monetary system does not look super stable to me.
  people will always argue how much money should i get. and even if i get some
  money, the next day it might become worthless because some rogue algorithm
  messed up the whole financial system. infrastructure sounds a more stable
  proposition. just because new york exploded, does not mean that the porridge
  reserves in my town evaporate into air. i can still rely on receiving food the
  next day.
</li><li>
  system understanding: in my opinion it is important for the members of a
  community to understand how their community works so that they easily help
  out. understanding infrastructure is much easier than understanding the
  financial system. the goal of the infrastructure is to satisfy the needs of
  its users. the problems that can arise are usually technical in nature. if
  there is no water then somebody can go and repair the pipes or get water via
  alternative means. if the rent is too high in a city, people cannot just go
  and make it lower.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and the ideal way to design such &quot;living infrastructure&quot; is to have the
designers actually live in the infrastructure they designed. they would have an
intrinsic motivation to ensure it works well. i am sure they could come up with
a long list of reasons why it would not suit them but so would anyone else. this
is why this requirement is needed: to design something that actually works.
</p>

<p>
note that i do not advocate against money or even against giving people free
money. i think that is all fine. what i argue for is that one should not require
money just to co-exist happily on this planet. it is useful for trading,
building new things. but humanity should have a minimum standard of living that
is not based on the fictional money but rather on the actual needs of the
planet&apos;s inhabitants. once most people have access to that, money can be seen as
a tool for the extra benefits society provides. until that happens, i will see
money as something to stress about.
</p>

<h2 id="hierarchies">hierarchies</h2>
<p>
file hierarchies are an effective way to organize a large set of documents,
like, source code trees, personal files, photos or music collections. however i
often see quite deep hierarchies for these files. i think that is a bad idea.
the nesting should be quite shallow. most projects or organizations do not need
more than 2 levels. anything on top of that probably is not adding a lot of
value and is just making it harder to navigate said files.
</p>

<p>
if i need more than two levels then chances are i am better off with some sort
of database to categorize the files. let me take the hypothetical example of
organizing photos into a directory structure. you might start out with a
structure like this:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/[year]/[name of the event]/[device]/0001.jpg ... 9999.jpg
</pre>

<p>
so when i go skying and make one photo with a phone then two photos with a
camera, i would have these three files:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/2018/skying/phone/0001.jpg
 photos/2018/skying/camera/0001.jpg
 photos/2018/skying/camera/0002.jpg
</pre>

<p>
but would such organization give me any value? whenever i organize something
into directory, i ask myself: will i ever do an operation on all the files under
this directory but not on others? if the answer is no, then clearly i do not
need the extra directory. if the answer &quot;all the time&quot;, then a directory is a
good choice for the organization. if the answer is &quot;sometimes&quot; then it is a
tradeoff. how much annoyance am i adding to my day to day life by putting this
under a directory? i will need extra keypresses, clicks and mental effort
whenever i want to navigate to a set of pictures. it is a small extra cost but
over time it adds up so it is worth to consider.
</p>

<p>
in the above example i do not think that organizing based on the device matters
at all. why should care what device i used after 10 years? i probably long
forgotten about them. so i would get rid of the device directory. on the other
hand the name of the event does matter. i might often want to check out a
specific event i feel nostalgic about. the year is a bit trickier. i probably
will not care about it 99% of the times. i occasionally might want check what
events happened in a specific year but i do not think that i should organize my
files according to that use case. so in this case my structure would look like
this:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/[name of the event]/[timestamp].jpg
</pre>

<p>
so the listing of those 3 files would be the following:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/firstskying/20180112223456.jpg
 photos/firstskying/20180113144455.jpg
 photos/firstskying/20180113144523.jpg
</pre>

<p>
notice that since i can no longer rely on year to separate similar event, i had
to change the name of the event to something more memorable. i went for
&quot;firstskying&quot; in this example since it could represent the photos from my first
skying vacation. on linux i can still easily look up what vacations i went in a
specific year:
</p>

<pre>
 $ ls photos/*/2018* | cut -d2 -f2 | sort -u
</pre>

<p>
and the common task of &quot;look at all the photos from an event&quot; is also very easy:
</p>

<pre>
 $ [pictureapp] photos/firstskying/*
</pre>

<p>
if i were very fancy, i could even add additional tags to the photos (e.g. the
device that made the photo) and store all that in a lightweight database. then i
can use a rich query language to get a list of files for arbitrary conditions.
this solution still does not require directories and easily scales to arbitrary
number of tag types. suppose i add some tags to each photo and then store that
it a text file like this:
</p>

<pre>
 $ cat photodb
 photos/firstskying/20180112223456.jpg night friday phone skying ...
 photos/firstskying/20180113144455.jpg day saturday camera skying ...
 photos/firstskying/20180113144523.jpg day saturday camera skying ...
</pre>

<p>
then it is very easy to query for specific tags and then display just those.
e.g. i remember that i have a funny photo from one of the skying events that
happened on a friday night. then i can search for it like this:
</p>

<pre>
 [pictureapp] $(grep skying photodb | grep friday | grep night | cut -d&apos; &apos; -f1)
</pre>

<p>
probably i could make this a lot smarter and easier to use but the point stands
that if i have lots of documents, then i should not use the directory hierarchy
to over-organize them but rather use a specialized organizing tool or database.
</p>

<p>
in this example i went from 3 levels to 1 level. i find the one level
organization more helpful. it is much simpler, memorable and more accessible.
all it required is some active thought about organization.
</p>

<p>
reorganizing multi-person projects is a little bit trickier though. as an
individual project member i probably do not have a good insight how others use
the project. however we can use conway&apos;s law to help us. it states the
following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs
  which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
at first it sounds as something bad. but when i thought a little bit more about
this, i think this law is something i should embrace rather than work against.
suppose i have a news site and i want to track its source and content in a
monolithic version control system. this might be the hypothetical history of the
company:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i hire programmers to build an awesome webserver. they work under the
  /webserver directory.
</li><li>
  when the webserver is ready, they also write some scripts to run it. to not
  mix code and scripts, they split the files into /webserver/code and
  /webserver/scripts.
</li><li>
  over time running that awesome webserver turns out to be a lot of work, so i
  hire sysadmins to keep it up. these sysadmins also want to monitor the website
  so they split the scripts into /webserver/scripts/runscripts and
  /webserver/scripts/monitoring.
</li><li>
  i hire writers to write some content. they put their content under /content.
</li><li>
  i want the website to look fancy so i hire some ui designers who put their
  stuff under /webserver/frontend.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so i ended up with this hierarchy:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /content
</li><li>
  /webserver/code
</li><li>
  /webserver/frontend
</li><li>
  /webserver/scripts/runscripts
</li><li>
  /webserver/scripts/monitoring
</li>
</ul>

<p>
with such a hierarchy a significant portion of the project members have to deal
with the /webserver prefix daily completely unnecessary. so instead of
subdividing the project among the lines what sounds logical, i would divide it
along the team boundaries. that is what conway&apos;s law suggests if i twist it hard
enough. so i would have this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /content
</li><li>
  /frontend
</li><li>
  /scripts/runscripts
</li><li>
  /scripts/monitoring
</li><li>
  /webserver
</li>
</ul>

<p>
each team has its own top level directory under which they can do anything they
wish. most teams do not suffer the unnecessary burden of extra hierarchy. in
such situation if i get annoyed with an overly long path, it is only my team who
i need to convince to refactor the files. the changes under my team&apos;s directory
would not affect other teams too much. i can freely create directories under my
team&apos;s name, i do not need to concern about the fact whether it sounds logical
or not, or seek approvals from other teams. the hierarchy is not really getting
into my way, it is just a tool to divide the land of the shared file tree.
</p>

<p>
this approach leads to a very shallow directories with many entries. that sounds
like a nightmare to manage. but once i am over the initial shock, i actually
find it very efficient. i do not spend ages contemplating whether i should put
the logger.c file under the code/util directory or the code/system directory.
and i do not need remember where i put it either. if i am looking for it, i can
just do a &quot;ls *log*&quot; and find it quite quickly. no need for fancy recursive
searching.
</p>

<p>
a word of warning. i think symlinks should be avoided if possible. there is a
lot of value of every file having a unique path to it. if i start using
symlinks, i might start referring to some files through the symlink and that
would lead to bad habits. having unique paths to files makes referring to the
files clearer. if i use a symlink, i really want it to be obvious. maybe its
name should contain the fact that the file is a symlink, e.g. a .lnk extension.
this way there will be less confusion about the canonicality of a file. it will
be obvious from &quot;/runscripts.lnk/start.sh&quot; that this start.sh does not belong to
a &quot;runscripts&quot; team, it is just a shortened filename.
</p>

<p>
benefits of shallow hierarchies is not restricted to filesystems only. url
structures for websites should be quite shallow too. if i were to operate an
online store then i would keep my products at urls like myshop.com/1234578.
non-numbers would trigger searches. e.g. myshop.com/leather+shoe would search
for leather shoes. i think that is more usable than a url like
myshop.com/search?lang=en&amp;location=us&amp;num=20&amp;query=leather+shoes. the former is
easily to remember and share while the latter is a nightmare. i could type out
shareable links for that site without even needing to visit my url to verify
because its structure so simple. you can still create custom, non-search pages
if you put a slash at the end to indicate you are not trying to search. e.g.
myshop.com/login/ could go to the login page without confusing it with a search
query.
</p>

<p>
to sum all the above up: i prefer shallower directory structures because once i
am familiar with the environment, shallow structures make navigation easier for
me. if i find the shallow structure hard to navigate, i try to use a search tool
instead of making overly deep, hierarchical structures.
</p>

<h2 id="challenges">challenges</h2>
<p>
i really liked puzzles and challenges as a kid. i participated in programming
competitions and some easier math ones as well. the problem with competitions
was that whenever i lost, i felt quite sad. especially if the competition had a
form of direct elimination. e.g. if i was not in the top n then i did not pass
to the next round. when i was eliminated then i felt dumb, i was not part of the
&quot;elite&quot;, i did not have the &quot;smarts&quot; to enter the next round. it was a very
discouraging feeling. however winning such competitions was an awesome feeling.
i felt proud of myself and even got prizes to boot.
</p>

<p>
interestingly, i had similar feelings about school exams. there too i felt the
dread and stress of failure. it might have been even worse a bit because even
though the bar was lower, the stakes were higher: if i fail, bad things will
happen to me. e.g. i get exposed to even more exams unvoluntarily. i tried to
ignore grades but i did felt pressure for good grades. so bad grades also made
me sad.
</p>

<p>
another frustrating part of these exercises is their randomness factor. i never
knew what to expect. especially bad were the ones where the examiner gave me a
random subject and then i had to talk just about that subject. what fascinates
me is that in such cases i always managed to get a subject i happened to know.
as my studies progressed, i even started to rely on this more and more and learn
less and less. this was very risky, yet my luck persisted.
</p>

<p>
now that school is over, i am no longer subject to these experiences. i miss
them a bit though. it is not the dread and stress i miss. it is not even the
sense of achievement i miss. if that would be the case then just competing and
succeeding in online programming competitions would give me the same dopamine
shot i am missing. yet they do not. i tried doing them but i simply did not have
the same motivation. i did not find them that much interesting. i do not think i
just &quot;grew up&quot;. i sort of feel the same as i was a kid. it is just my
environment and my interaction with it that completely changed. however if i
would get back into the same environment, i would probably enjoy the same things
as i enjoyed as a kid.
</p>

<p>
my childhood competitions and exams were in an environment of friends and
family. these people knew whenever i attended these exams and competitions. they
always asked about the results. when i got good results, i felt good about
myself because i understood that it meant something for these people. they might
have felt proud of me. i never bragged though. i just let people be naturally
curious (where were you yesterday?) and ask questions (oh really? how did you
fare?). i never liked to talk about myself so i tried to dismiss questions but
after enough nagging or some other ways (e.g. teacher announcing everyone&apos;s
results) people found out. i had this &quot;thing&quot; where i preferred that people find
out stuff about me from other ways than me talking about it. maybe this is a
form of signal that said person was so interested in me that they looked up or
asked information about me, remembered it and then asked me about it. a sort of
honest, non-fakeable flattery. it felt good. i guess i am a narcissist. but i am
digressing.
</p>

<p>
so achievements of exams and competitions felt good because i felt that i
impressed nearby friends and family. it was important that i impressed people i
knew. impressing strangers is boring. i mean just compare the following two
statements: &quot;a random korean guy won a starcraft competition&quot; vs &quot;your friend
won the bowling nationals&quot;. which one is more exciting? the latter excites me
more because then i want my friend to talk about it. the former i just simply do
not care about. now that i grew up, it is very hard to impress people, i do not
usually get such feedback. if i had some friends with whom i would continue to
do programming competitions, i think i would find it fun. but i am not a person
with many friends. it is not that people run away from me, it is more that i do
not even try acquire or meet people. anyways, digressing again.
</p>

<p>
even though this game is over for me, it does not mean i cannot create an
environment where people can acquire such experiences. however if i am going to
do this, i want to remove the elements of dread, stress, randomness, lost
opportunities and so on. at some point in my life (maybe when i am retired) i
would like to try creating a particular &quot;challenge&quot;. let me describe the rules
and then i will explain why i like the idea:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the challenge is to write a piece of software (solving a random collection of
  problems, e.g. given graph find shortest path, string manipulation, etc, stuff
  that i can easily verify).
</li><li>
  the challenge is static, never changes.
</li><li>
  the challenge is online, one can practice for it any way they wish.
</li><li>
  the taker must solve the challenge in barebones c programming language. the
  taker cannot even use the standard library (i provide a read and write
  function).
</li><li>
  the taker can attempt the challenge once every 3 months and it is free of
  charge.
</li><li>
  the takers must come to my house and use my restricted environment to take the
  challenge while i observe them so that they do not cheat.
</li><li>
  before attempting the challenge, the taker must send a fully correct solution
  to me. i need this to avoid situations where people come to me without any
  hopes to finish the challenge.
</li><li>
  at least one week before the first attempt, the taker must come to my house
  and do an exercise run. this ensures that the test takers are aware of the
  challenge&apos;s environment and gives me a way to become friends before i take on
  my adversial position as the challenge&apos;s proctor.
</li><li>
  the taker cannot use any helper material to complete the challenge other than
  the crappy computer i provide. not even a handwritten post-it note. i do
  provide a pen and paper for writing notes from scratch.
</li><li>
  the taker has 4 hours to complete the challenge. once they finish, i test
  their code and tell them if they passed or not. no bathroom breaks, drinking
  or anything allowed during those 4 hours (unless medical reasons).
</li><li>
  upon successfully completing the challenge, the taker&apos;s name will appear in
  the challenge&apos;s hall of fame. there would be also prices for the completers
  although age limited (e.g. prices only for &lt;= 16 years old). giving chocolate
  or something to middle aged people for completing a coding challenge seems
  weird.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i have not fully thought out the challenge but i think those rules achieve most
of the features i want the challenge to have. here are my reasons why i would
like this challenge as a taker:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i know what the challenge asks. i know if i am prepared for the challenge or
  not. i do not need to stress about &quot;what are they going to ask me?&quot;.
</li><li>
  the challenge&apos;s result does not depend on other people. if i pass, i am on the
  hall of fame regardless of others.
</li><li>
  the programming environment is very simple, very equalizing. since i cannot
  use the standard library, i know that i do not need to stress about memorizing
  the parameter order of qsort. i just need to learn qsort itself. maybe it is
  harder but i feel better if i know qsort&apos;s algorithm rather than just the
  argument order.
</li><li>
  because i can retry in short period of time, the failure is not a big deal.
  there are no limits on the amount of retries. i can keep trying until i
  succeed. and whether i succeed or not, depends only on my willpower, i do not
  lose anything even if it takes me 5 years to succeed.
</li><li>
  since there is a cooldown period between attempts, i have a chance to really
  think through my next attempt rather than just brute forcing through the
  challenge.
</li><li>
  since the challenge occurs in a very controlled environment, i know that every
  member of the hall of fame went through the same process as i did. i know
  there are no cheaters among them, and i know that others also know that i
  cannot be a cheater.
</li><li>
  the challenge is geographically limited so it is not something anybody can do.
  the hall of fame will not be filled with random people all around the world
  that i cannot possibly know. in fact since only close people can do it
  (especially thanks to the silly 1 week exercise run), it is highly likely that
  the people on the hall of the fame are people i can befriend or just go and
  visit. then i can ask for their advice. doing this in the real world rather
  than through anonymous online discussions is much more satisfying. even if i
  communicate via email, just knowing that the other side is near me makes
  things more satisfying.
</li><li>
  since the challenge does not allow any helping tools or materials, all i can
  fall back to is myself. there is no greater equalizer than stripping ourselves
  from our tools and resources. this way i know that all the hall of fame
  members all only used only their minds. i do not need to stress whether i have
  the best books with me or not, or whether my notes contain everything or not.
  it is just me and the challenge.
</li><li>
  4 hours is limit i need to work with. it is something to which i have to adapt
  my bodily functions. i feel i need to urinate in a higher frequency, well, i
  have all the more motivation to work faster.
</li><li>
  once i finish the challenge, i appear on the hall of the fame. if the
  challenge is hard enough so that only a few people are on it, then randomly
  meeting my fellow hall of famers at some random future point is a great
  bonding opportunity. i now immediately have a common topic i can rant about
  and ask the other person&apos;s experience of the challenge. it is also a nice
  feeling if my non-programming peers find it and then start asking about it.
</li><li>
  there is one perverse incentive with the age limited prices. maybe the price
  is a bike that the kids do not really need since they sit at home all day
  long. even if i cannot get the price anymore directly, i could still strike a
  deal with kids that i will prepare them for the challenge in exchange they
  give up the price (or a portion of the price) for me. this way i would have an
  incentive to train the next generation for the challenge.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so that would be my idea. the challenge itself is not very practical. but i do
not think everything in life must be strictly practical. it is a game. no need
to play if it does not sound interesting.
</p>

<p>
ideally when i retire, i will do so in a small city and could run such a
challenge from my home mostly for the nearby kids. maybe i could present
multiple challenges with varying difficulties and then advertise the challenge
in the local school. it would be completely optional, i would not expect too
many kids to try. however i can play with the prizes. if nobody attempts, i can
just keep raising the prize until a few kids get so obsessed with it that they
will start training for the challenge. it is an easy way to get some people
motivated to do something i want. there is not much point to this other than
getting onto the hall of fame. however if they manage to get there, they might
get interested in other, more mature competitions and this might kickstart their
interest in computer science.
</p>

<p>
since i think i would be pretty comfortable with such challenges, i wonder if
similar conditions could apply to school exams. i could split school exams into
two categories: the mandatory exams and the extracurricular exams. both types
would be binary: pass or fail. there is no grading. however there would be no
punishment for failing. they could just retry 3 months later. the mandatory
exams would be super basic: it is just to confirm that they can read, write,
count, know the basics of ethics (do not hurt others), know some basic stuff
about everyday life (monetary skills like avoiding credit or the concept of
interest rates), some basic life skills (cooking an egg). the extracurricular
exams would be about history, algebra, literature, programming, sewing, cooking,
woodworking and others (each subject would have multiple exams with varying
difficulties). kids could do the exams any time they want, in any order (as long
as they take at least 1 each month for instance). the nice thing is that then
the kids can direct their knowledge intake as they wish. if they do not have
preference, others can suggest them exams to take. the learning part of the
studies is left to the kids to figure out. sure, they can attend classes but if
they feel they can go faster than the rest, they can just take the exams sooner
and not bother with the classes. and just to make sure kids have an incentive
for collaborating, they could have random study groups where all members have to
pass a specific exam. the study group members now have to branch out subjects
outside their interest. if a member is not interested in the subject at all, the
other study group members must somehow work with the disinterested kid to
convince and teach the kid about the subject for the greater good. they have to
do so because the rule would be to not allow the study members take more exams
until they get everyone on their group to pass the random exam. anyways, i am
just rambling random ideas. the point is, rather than forcing a very strict
curriculum and punishing failure, i would much prefer to give more choice for
kids to pursue education in the areas they like and at the pace they want, have
easier and less stressful exams (they are kids afterall) and avoid punishment
for failing exams but rather teach to keep trying, regardless of failures.
</p>

<h2 id="efficiency">efficiency</h2>
<p>
it is very easy for me to fall into the trap of obsessing about efficiency.
efficiency can mean many things: in software i might be optimizing for minimal
ram usage, minimal time use, or in real world i might be optimizing to spend as
little money as possible. however achieving peak efficiency has downsides. the
principle of pareto efficiency suggests that the more efficient i make
something, i lose optimality in other dimensions. the principle introduces the
concept of pareto frontier: when i am on the frontier any improvement in my
preferred dimension will result in decline in some other dimension. examples:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i want my software to use very little memory. but to achieve this i would need
  to use very complex data structures and thus maintaing the software would be a
  nightmare.
</li><li>
  i am a baker and i want to bake bread as cheap as possible. therefore i will
  look for the cheapest flour possible. but such flour makes my bread taste and
  smell bad. i compensate by adding even more cheap additives. now i am not
  selling bread anymore just a bread-like hodgepodge.
</li><li>
  i want to commute to work in minimal time possible. so i take a bike instead
  of walking. but now i have to bike next to the traffic and as such it is super
  stressful. i am exposing myself to a lot of stress in exchange of less time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i am not saying that i should embrace inefficiency but rather just to avoid the
obsession to be at the frontier. it is much easier to adapt to the changing
world when i have a lot of wiggle room. this leads me to the next question: why
the obsession about the efficiency?
</p>

<p>
suppose i am a big company. i make 100 million dollars yearly. if i hire a
person that can make 1% improvement to my processes then that means i can now
make 101 million dollars yearly. that is 1 million dollars worth of extra money
in exchange for one person&apos;s salary. sure, it adds complexity to my processes
but that person can deal with it so it is a sound tradeoff.
</p>

<p>
other examples: i am a farmer and improving crop efficiency means i can feed
more people. or improving fuel efficiency means less pollution. in many the
other cases like these the benefits do outweigh the downsides. but it is
important to be aware of those downsides.
</p>

<p>
the common theme i see is that efficiency starts to matter mostly in large
systems where even the smallest improvements lead to large, quantifiable
differences. the same system can also afford the kafkaesque complexity stemming
from all the small efficiency &quot;improvements&quot;. but when other people try to use
or rely on the output of that system then they are inadvertently exposed to the
risks stemming from all that complexity.
</p>

<ul><li>
  in the software&apos;s case i would get giant, unmaintainable codebases. i would be
  discouraged to even attempt fixing bugs in software because i do not know
  where to even start or my machine is not powerful to build the software in
  question.
</li><li>
  in the crops case i might get more confident about my farming abilities and
  start growing a single plant with great efficiency. the risk here is that a
  lot of people might start depending on me solely. if some unforeseen problem
  arises with my plant and i lose a year&apos;s worth of crop that will expose all
  those people to huge amount of risk. in the case where i am forced to keep a
  large variety of plants with various successes it would keep people&apos;s
  expectations in check.
</li><li>
  or take the fuel efficiency example: it means that more people can afford
  personal cars, less pollution means less people will be advocating against
  cars, which means there is the chance that there will be a demand for even
  more cars and in total there will be more pollution by making all those cars.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
although i enjoy the efficiencies of the modern world but when it comes to my
own projects, i stopped caring about efficiency and optimality. my new focus is
to not let things grow unbounded. i set arbitrary limits on myself or on the
software i write and i adhere to them. when i reach a limit somewhere, i take a
deep look to see if i can solve the problem in a different way so that i do not
need to increase the limit. this approach lets me avoid being stuck in some
local minima and reach much higher efficiencies in total. for example if i have
a simple software that only solves 80% of my usecase, i will try changing my
usecase rather than grabbing a more complex software. usually my environment
gets simpler in exchange. for instance if all i want to have a blog with some
text in it, i can just write simple text files rather than html or other
complicated markup that needs various postprocessing before i can serve them.
this way i do not need to deal with fonts, css, hyperlinks and whatnot. only the
important bit, the text itself, remains. and most important observation from
this is that when i avoid the unnecessary fluff, things get miraculously
efficient. for instance this website loads quite fast without any effort on my
side. no need to set up compression or use fancy protocols to make it fast.
</p>

<p>
i am pretty sure the efficiency stemming from limits extends to other cases too.
if we did not have that much cars available, people would be more dependent on
public transportation so the planet in total would be more efficient. or if less
food would be available, we would have also less waste so probably we would try
to be more conscious about food. of course we would have harder, less convenient
life but potentially more efficient in exchange. this might not sound appealing
for everyone but i think applying some limits on ourselves might get us some
improvements and efficiencies in exchange without an explicit focus on
efficiency itself.
</p>

<h2 id="motivation">motivation</h2>
<p>
some days i struggle to get myself to do anything at all. i wake up, do my daily
routines but then i spend most of my time with work related stuff like reading
and responding to emails. when i get home i play with family and afterwards i go
to bed and sleep until tomorrow. i do not spend time on hobby projects or on
learning new stuff. weekends are not more productive either. when i was a kid, i
found computer programming quite fun and exciting. i enjoyed solving project
euler puzzles, acm style programming competition problems and writing small
tools here and there. in order to do those i needed to learn about math,
algorithms, programming languages and best practices, operating systems, english
language and many other topics. but today? i feel like i am not learning new
things. that would be fine as long as i would be working on something meaningful
instead, harvesting all the knowledge. that is not happening either. it is like
my time is flying by and i do not have anything to show up in exchange. i am not
investing my time into anything.
</p>

<p>
there are a few differences in my current life compared to my kid life though.
when i was a kid i had a lot more free time. i was much earlier home compared to
my typical work day. when i was home, i had private room where people left me
alone so i could do anything without disturbances. today i do not have any
privacy. at work i am in an open plan office and at home i have my computer in
the living room so that i do not isolate myself too much from others. this makes
concentration harder especially if others are doing distracting activities. this
somewhat explains why i feel i have little free time and the easier
distractability but it does not explain the lack of motivation i am feeling.
</p>

<p>
to clarify this lack of motivation is not depression. i do not feel depressed.
it is more like i feel that everything that is important already exists so i do
not see the need to create more software. now that i grew up and got a broad
enough overview about the software field, i feel like the software world hit a
plateau in the late 1980s as people finished implementing all the obvious
software and today&apos;s software and computing is just mostly fluff. i feel like we
are over-softwarizing our environment where all we would need is just saner
practices or solutions and then we would not need said software. it is probably
better to leave this topic for a separate blog entry in the future for now as it
is off topic.
</p>

<p>
it is not only software i am not that much interested though. achieving anything
for me is a burden. let it be exercise, cooking, cleaning. to compensate i just
avoid having bad habits and thus i do not have problems with health or
messiness. i walk to the office, i keep a super clean desk, i do not smoke, i do
not drink alcohol or sugary drinks, i do not buy crap i do not need, i do not
even have money on me most of the time and so on.
</p>

<p>
yet i still function. i can still keep my job, i still occasionally make a tool
for myself, clean the house, or just generally keep myself alive. how so? i am
definitely not intrinsically motivated to do these things. the motivation comes
from external sources. it is either something annoying me or somebody nagging
me. if i am annoyed with a flaky or inflexible tool, i am somewhat inclined to
write my own version of it. if somebody is pestering me about something, i am
somewhat inclined to do what they want to stop them from pestering me. the
latter has a quite a strong effect on me. if somebody sends me a message, i have
this very strong urge to always have the last word. it is almost and ocd like
tick. if that message has a simple request or a question, i have an urge to do
whatever it asked me or come up with a very good reason why i cannot do it.
these two things get me through my life these days. if the toilet is so dirty
that i am annoyed then i clean it. if at work somebody assigns me a small bug to
fix, i fix it.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand if the floor is only a little dirty, i will probably not do
anything about it. i am not annoyed so it is fine as it is. as for the second
case: if at work somebody assigns me a big project that needs a lot of
consideration and coordination, i am at a loss. driving such work requires a lot
of inner motivation which i lack. in such cases i rely on having management
aiding me. talking through a project with another person, splitting it into
smaller pieces and then having a manager pestering me about it really does help
me. it is no wonder rubber duck debugging is a thing, it is just that a rubber
duck is not as motivating as a human could be.
</p>

<p>
i recently came across the concept of &quot;accountability partner&quot;. once you find a
partner, both of you agree to a set of goals, you keep periodically reporting to
each other about the progress of your goals and keep each other accountable for
those goals. it is similar to coaching. i think the difference is that while a
coach coaches you, you do not really give anything in return while you do
provide value for your accountability partner. the latter does not feel too much
of a one sided burden. if i were to stop adhering to my goals, that might make
the partner also stop adhering which would make me feel guilty so i am
personally incentivized to adhere to my goals. basically this is setting up the
nagging feeling for myself. i have not really tried this. if i ever find myself
wanting to do a small project, i would totally try this. now if only i had
friends for this. maybe acquiring more friends should be one project. oh well,
something to think about.
</p>

<p>
so to sum up: i am no longer motivated intrinsically about things like when i
was a kid. i can get around this by having an environment that still motivates
me extrinsically to do things that i really need to get done. however it does
not really lead to working on original, novel things. for that i have no
solution.
</p>

<h2 id="boy">boy</h2>
<p>
boy&apos;s life started out quite simple. he lived in a small farming town, he was
surrounded by loving and supporting family. he spent most of his early days
either fooling around with neighbor&apos;s grandchildren outside whenever they were
around or just watching television. he liked watching sci-fi shows. as time
passed, he started nagging his parents for a computer because that is what he
has seen a lot in the tv shows. the parents were financially strapped so it took
them a while but they eventually found someone with a very old computer that
they wanted to throw out. boy got his first second hand computer. he fell in
love with it. he spent a lot of time with it. he was playing video games and
also learning programming in the hopes creating new games. as time went on he
grew apart from the neighbor&apos;s grandchildren since they started to spend less
and less time around. to understand the computers better boy started attending a
extracurricular computer class. he managed to find a friend there who also liked
to play video games. he befriended him and they visited each other often to play
games.
</p>

<p>
boy spent most of his teenage years in a single school. for 8 years he studied
with the same set of roughly 20 people. his classmates were nice people, they
liked each other. boy was friendly and a relatively good student. he liked
attending school. he liked its relatively rigid structure. he went in the
morning, attended the classes and then went home. he was a person of habits so
this worked well. nothing extraordinary happened in his life and he was happy
like that. he kept learning about computers privately. he wanted to become the
best programmer in the world. he thought that when he reaches the ultimate
computer mastery then fame and fortune will follow and everything will be okay.
he spent most of his afterschool time alone in his private room fooling around
with his computer.
</p>

<p>
he started noticing something during his late teenager years. more and more of
his classmates started hating school. some of them even skipped some of the
classes. some of them started going to pubs or just generally hang around after
the school. this was odd to him but he kept enjoying school and always went home
to his computer afterwards. on some occassions he went along with others into
pubs to see what was it all about. every time he did so he found himself in a
completely new environment with many strangers all talking. he did not like the
situation. all he could think of is going back to his more familiar places. the
topics people talked about were all sorts of things boy had no experience with.
music, dating, talking about other people. people drank alcohol and smoked
cigarettes. boy completely refused to do those things since he was afraid those
acts might interfere with his goal of infallible mental acuity needed for being
the best programmer. he completely avoided going to such places. he continued to
stay at home outside school.
</p>

<p>
during his teenager years he continued the playdates with his video game friend.
when they got a bit older, that friend introduced porn to boy. friend brought
some porn pictures on a floppy disk. boy did not understand it first. so friend
decided to do something that really surprised boy: he started masturbating in
front of him. he finished with an ejaculation which was also a completely new
thing he knew nothing about. friend then said that boy should try this too, it
will be fun. boy got curious and said sure and asked for instructions. there
they were, two adolescent boys, showing their penises to each other and trying
to masturbate. this was the first time boy remembers seeing another penis. he
might have glanced one or two in the past but this was the first time he had a
chance to actually take a more detailed look. boy had his own penis right there
to compare. it looked different. the foreskin on boy&apos;s penis did not cover his
glans. friend&apos;s foreskin could stretch long enough to cover that part. boy then
suddenly remembered that he had a surgery on his penis when he was a kid. his
parents were sometimes questioning him whether he can &quot;pull off his skin&quot; there
or not. he was quite shy person so when the parents insisted on showing it, he
just quickly showed that no, he cannot do that. they took him to a doctor who
signed him up for a surgery. boy did not really understand the whole thing that
is happening around him. he noticed that his penis looks a bit different after
the surgery but he did not think of it much and soon has forgotten about it. as
boy explains this to friend, boy gets a bit scared about it. did the doctors
actually mutilate his penis? friend immediately calms him down that this is
nothing to worry about, it is not that important part of the penis. then he
instructs boy that he should start stroking itself. boy does but nothing much
happens. he does not feel much. his friend plays videogames in the meantime. boy
keeps stroking penis as his friend recommends. nothing happened at that point so
after a while boy stopped and continued playing video games as if nothing
happened.
</p>

<p>
the penis difference kept bugging him. around that time his school got internet
access so he picked a quiet, private corner machine in the computer lab and
started researching penises. he learned that the operation he had was a
circumcision. he learned that while it is common in some cultures, it is not
common where he is coming from. the feeling he got is that circumcision is
associated with a stigma. the idea was that it was something that only an
unrespected ethnic group did to their babies so if people were to figure out
that he is circumcised then they would make fun out of him and would outcast
him. boy felt ashamed about this part of him. he felt that this is something he
must hide from others.
</p>

<p>
as most teenager boys, boy kept playing with his penis now and then. eventually
he managed to get his first ejaculation. then porn started getting more and more
interesting. friend brought even more porn for him. they even masturbated
together. porn was exciting for boy. after a while it was not really the sexual
act that he found most interesting in it. it was the fact that the people in
porn could completely disrobe in front of each other without any shame. it was
something he could not imagine comfortable doing himself due to his fear of
shame. being naked became a symbol of power for him. he wanted to be able to do
what people in porn do. being naked in front of others, being comfortable with
the raw human bodies and let him explore other people&apos;s bodies and let others
explore his. his porn taste was quite soft compared to what was available. all
he was interested in was casual nudity. his environment was quite conservative,
he did not experience much nudity which made him even more thirstier. in reality
he spent most of his time at home, he did not even have the chance to see others
in nude, and he did not have the chance to show off himself. though he did not
want to show off himself due to his inhibitions. he did not talk about this to
anyone. he managed to get through high school keeping all this to himself
without ever satisfying his curiosity.
</p>

<p>
years passed and boy finished his high school and off he went to a big city to
study computers in a prestigious university and to experience new adventures.
boy entered the real world. he did not really knew anyone in this new place. the
university classes were differently structured than his high school. no longer
was the case that a specific group is glued together for long hours and are
forced to work together every day. it was the wild west, everyone was for
themselves. the only thing that saved him was his interest in computer
competitions that he started doing in his high school times. he always done well
in them. he wanted to continue them in his university. the most prestigious
contest required teams with 3 members. he managed to find two other people for
this. during his high school years boy was active on a computer forum where he
liked to help people. by luck he managed to befriend one person there who
happened to start university at the same time as he was. he found another one by
looking at past high school competitions to see if there are high achievers in
his classes. boy then took the strength and asked one of them to join his team.
and so he found a few friends with whom he continued to attend competitions and
classes. later they even became roommates in the university&apos;s cheap dormitories.
</p>

<p>
the first three years of the university were quite busy, much busier than high
school so that kept boy quite occupied. since dormitories offered 4 person
rooms, he did not have much privacy either. he got through these years quite
quickly. his fantasies and inhibitions did not change. he was still super shy so
avoided anything that might expose him. much like in high school he also avoided
all social gatherings. he did not really miss them since he got plenty social
interactions from university and roommates. by the end of the third year he also
realized that becoming the best programmer was not realistic. in this place he
was not the brightest person anymore. this demotivated him. he started caring
about grades an his studies even less. he was still a good student but became a
lazy one. this and the unfulfilled fantasies made life look bleak to him.
</p>

<p>
since boy was already quite familiar with computers by the time he got to the
university, he managed to find a summer internship place in a nearby big,
multinational company. he worked there each summer since his first university
break. the company quite liked him so boy agreed to start working part time when
he started his fourth year at university. he got disillusioned with the
university so he liked this offer. at the same time that year he did not get a
place in the dormitory. he was now on his own. when he got the rejection letter
from the dormitory, he got a bit scared. he thought maybe he should rent a place
since he is now making money anyways. he started looking at rentals, picked the
first nearby, nice looking studio apartment and quickly moved in. he did not
give it much thought but it worked out well. he got a nice place. he liked it.
he was alone. he got back his privacy. he could do anything without anyone
looking. the shared living at a dormitory started bugging him anyways due to the
incompatible waking hours some roommates lived by.
</p>

<p>
his daily habit was to go to university for a few classes, then go to work for a
few hours and then go home. as weeks passed his disillusion with life and the
unfulfilled fantasies started growing. since boy was not spending much time in
university anymore, he grew apart from his friends. whenever he got home he
started wondering what is he doing with his life. interests in computers started
fading. there was not much point to it since he felt that there was not much
that he could contribute to the world anymore. there are smarter people around
for that and that is fine. most people around that time also had girlfriends,
were having fun and yet here he was as a virgin, he had not even seen real naked
woman in his life. he did not like the idea of visiting escorts because he was
still ashamed of himself. he felt like he could only share himself with a person
he knows well. he wanted a girlfriend, a person with whom he could share
anything, he wanted a family around himself. some days he went home, to his
lonely studio and he went straight to bed and cried himself into sleep because
nothing made sense for him, he could not see a future for himself.
</p>

<p>
boy was quite the lucky person. he had an easy life. parents provided well for
him. they did not give him everything he wanted but he got the things he really
wanted. he lucked out schools too. he was not bullied, he was around friendly
people. he lucked out exams too. he never studied very thoroughly but during
exams he always managed to randomly pick a topic he knew well so he managed to
slide through high schools and university exams without ever failing an exam.
his sheer luck also helped to meet the right person at the right time. on one
random day at his second university year he was sitting in the university&apos;s
lounge area with a concerned look on his face. a girl classmate was sitting next
to him. she keenly observed the distress and asked boy what is nagging him. boy
explained that last summer he worked in a summer internship and now he is
expected to file tax reports. boy had no idea what to do and he was not sure who
to ask about it. the girl in question, luckily for boy, happened to have an
accountant degree already. girl volunteered to help boy out. boy got super happy
about this. girl also happened to live in the same dormitory as boy. all he had
to do is go down a few floors in the evening, hand over the necessary documents
and let girl figure out the rest. life could not be easier. since she was the
first girl he talked to since he came to university, he wanted to have more
interactions with her. boy took a big breath and told girl that if she ever
needs help with her classes, he is happy to help out. it took a lot of courage
for boy to say this since he feared rejection. girl said thanks, she might get
back to boy later. she did so eventually. boy went over to her room quite a few
times to help with homework. girl had a boyfriend already in her hometown so boy
did not think of this relationship much. he really liked the fact that he can be
around a girl. boy also liked a roommate of girl&apos;s since she had qualities boy
could empathize with. roommate was smart, quiet, shy and friendly sounding. boy
felt the same about himself so she liked roommate. boy did not meet roommate a
lot though since girl and boy usually went to a more private areas to not
disturb the other two roommates and that they do not disturb them. boy was quite
shy in front of others anyways so he preferred it this way. not much more
happened between between girl and boy during those early years. boy happened to
hang around girl whenever she needed some help and girl helped out with boy&apos;s
tax documents once every year.
</p>

<p>
this relationship persisted even in the fourth academic year during boy&apos;s
depression. since neither of them were in dormitory anymore, they did their
occasional meetings in university lounges. girl was living at her relatives. boy
was reluctant to invite girl to his apartment to avoid looking like a creep who
is trying to hit on girls with boyfriends. eventually the topic came up, boy
told girl he is now renting a studio, and after another courage gathering
session he asked that she might as well come over there. to boy&apos;s surprise girl
agreed. girl started to come over to boy&apos;s place every few evening to study
together. some evenings she went home quite late. since she was already over to
boy&apos;s place and did not feel like going home, boy and girl watched movies
together or boy was showing off some magic tricks he learned on the internet.
what boy did not realize at that time is that girl dumped his boyfriend a few
months back. she even told this to boy once but it flew past boy&apos;s ears. one day
boy was chatting with girl on instant messaging. in that conversation girl got
tired and asked to have sex already. this request came when boy was deepest in
his depression. girl did not know about boy&apos;s depression. that day boy did not
cry. all he could think of is girl&apos;s message, seeing an actual woman naked, a
woman seeing him naked, and the fact that he can have his first sexual
experience. when boy got back his senses from the message, his body shame jumped
right back into his mind. after a few confirmational queries about his
understanding of the original message, he told girl he is circumcised and asked
how big of a deal that is. girl told him that such things do not bother her. she
then carefully asked if the circumcision was due to medical or other reasons.
this question did not bother boy, nor would any answer bother girl but it
confirmed for boy that indeed people in his area do associate circumcision with
ethnic rituals.
</p>

<p>
next time girl came over to boy&apos;s place, they did not bother with the studies.
they just lied on the bed. boy asked if he could kiss girl. she said yes. they
kissed. boy asked girl if she could take off her shirt. girl was a bit
uncomfortable with this but she agreed. boy asked the same about her bra. girl
was even more uncomfortable with this but eventually she agreed. boy could see
and touch real boobs the first time in his life. he was very happy. he enjoyed
the moment. boy asked about taking off the pants. girl said no. then they just
continued lying next to each other. boy was curious, he continued to pester
girl. he asked if he could at least touch her vulva. girl reluctantly agreed.
boy slided his hand into girl&apos;s pants. he touched it. he explored the vulva. it
was moist. he then pulled his hand back and put his fingers to his nose. he
examined it carefully. he even tasted it just to be sure since he was not sure
if opportunity will last or not. his hand then wandered back into the pants. boy
continued his blind vulva exploration. his curiosity grew. he asked again about
taking off the pants. girl agreed this time. boy did not hesitate, he took it
off. he liked what he was seeing. he examined his discovery from a very close
perspective. he immediately felt the need to use more senses for this
exploration like taste. he slowly started approached his target, and felt it all
around. he continued this exploration. girl was not objecting. after a few
minutes girl came. girl pushed away boy&apos;s face to stop boy&apos;s eagerness. she had
to rest. the fun was over for boy. hugging and silence followed the fun. girl
thanked boy and said that it is getting late, she should go home. she then
slowly got dressed and boy escorted her home.
</p>

<p>
boy was super happy. he now had a friend who fully trusted him with her body. he
felt like his fantasy came true. though it was not the full experience for him
since his penis had to remain at its dark place last time. however he knew that
the time is close. he will get to show off, use his penis and experience sex
too. boy walked around satisfied and excited about the future. he knew that more
adventure is around the corner. soon, girl was at boy&apos;s studio again. over
instant messaging boy convinced girl that they should have real sex next time.
he also asked girl to have low expectations, he never did such things, he will
probably utterly fail. this time both were ready to have sex. boy quickly
undressed girl. he played around her body again since boy&apos;s fascination with
bodies did not diminish. after a while boy also decided to undress, put on a
condom, and try to fumble his penis into girls vulva. he went in and minutes if
not seconds later he came. he had his first sex. he was a bit underwhelmed
though. partly because of his premature ejaculation, partly because of his
expectations. boy thought having his penis in a vulva will make the orgasm a
completely different, more extraordinary feeling. it was the same bodily feeling
as the old ejaculations he had. the difference this time was that he was with
another person. he still very much enjoyed it but in a different way. his penis,
his erect penis, the ejaculation to boy were increasingly more and more private
aspects of life. but here it was happening next to, inside another person&apos;s most
private body part. to boy this represented a very deep, trusting bond with the
other person. he did not care about the orgasm much, he cared about the intimacy
he managed experience that day. that is what he felt most satisfied about. sex
was a way to achieve that deep intimacy boy was longing for. hugging and
relaxation followed.
</p>

<p>
girl kept going to boy&apos;s place and they kept having sex in similar ways. boy
tried experimenting a little bit to see what differences are there to the
experience. boy was elated. after a short while he asked girl to have a shared
shower. boy wanted this so that he can show his body fully girl. so far girl did
not really see boy&apos;s body. while girl was lying on the bed, boy had to do
everything himself. he undressed himself, put his penis inside her, then later
cleaned up himself. during these acts girl did not stare at boy&apos;s crotch much.
he wanted to make himself easier to observe. they had their shower. boy proudly
showed presented himself to girl. girl was a bit shy but otherwise acted
completely casual. boy was completely mesmerized with girl&apos;s body. he could not
keep of his eyes of girl&apos;s body, he was mentally trying to crystallize the
experience into his memory. they showered together all right but to boy it did
not feel like girl is giving him as much attention as he is giving her. boy felt
the lack of interest but the possibility of being fearlessly naked and having
the possibility of freely explore girl&apos;s body overshadowed the lack of the
reciprocal feeling.
</p>

<p>
as boy got more experience in sex, his performance improved, sex was great.
everything worked like in the movies. girl continued to show generally less
lustful interest in boy&apos;s body. slowly boy understood that this was not due to
his body not being attractive but it was due to girl not as interested in nudity
itself. she had a different love language. boy did not feel fully satisfied. he
did not even fully stop with his porn addiction. his fantasies continued. he did
not hide this fact from girl. boy was super honest. girl did not really mind
that boy still looks at porn after boy fully explained how he thought. boy
really liked the fact that he can share any uncomfortable thoughts with girl and
that the girl accepts those without judgment. such unconditional acceptance was
part of his fantasy after all. even without the fully satisfied fantasies boy no
longer felt depressed. boy was happy. future was now full of possibilities.
</p>

<p>
girl started spending more and more time at boy&apos;s place. she even started
sleeping there overnight. boy liked girl and he liked that she spends so much
time with him. boy even fantasized growing old and having a family with girl.
after a while they wanted move together but girl did not really like boy&apos;s
studio because she did not like having everything in one big room. boy&apos;s rent
was quite high too. girl was thinking about renting a bigger and cheaper
apartment. meanwhile girl asked if her former roommate boy liked could sleep one
night there. roommate was also rejected from dormitory so she was sharing a flat
with 3 other girls. suddenly their landlords decided that they do not want to
rent their flat out anymore. she needed a new place quickly and she needed a
place to stay until she found a new place. boy immediately agreed. sleeping next
to two girls he really liked sounded like a dream coming true. boy had his
sleepover pajama party at its place. it was not terribly exciting since nothing
happened but the fact that both girl and roommate trusted him enough to sleep in
the same bed as him was a very comforting experience. girl slept in the middle
so there was no chance for funny business. this way girl did not really mind the
setup for a day. next day roommate explained that she needs to find a place not
only for herself but also for her sister so she was not sure what she is going
to do. boy, girl, and roommate knew each other for a while now and they liked
each other. girl proposed that maybe they should band together and rent a place
together. everybody agreed. girl and roommate hit the internets to find places
and started visiting apartments. boy did not really care much where he lived so
he let them do whatever they wanted. he had to go to university and then to work
anyways. the girls quickly found a nice 2 bedroom place and the next day all
four of them, sister included, visited and agreed to their new place where they
planned to spend most of their upcoming days.
</p>

<p>
the apartment was long and narrow. it had 4 rooms next to each other. bathroom,
bedroom 1, bedroom 2, kitchen. flatmate and sister lived in bedroom 1. in order
to get from bedroom 1 to kitchen, one had to go through bedroom 2. boy and girl
lived in bedroom 2. in order to go from bedroom 2 to bathroom, one had to go
through bedroom 1. unless one was alone, there was no real privacy for anyone.
girl&apos;s former roommate now became flatmate. boy did not really know flatmate&apos;s
sister until they actually moved in. he worried about this a bit. flatmate
previously explained sister is like her but younger so if he likes flatmate, he
will like sister too. this turned out to be true. boy noticed minor differences
though. sister was a bit less shy, more confident, she looked like she knew what
she wanted, like she had her whole life planned out. boy and sister liked each
other but boy liked flatmate better since he felt more commonality with her. boy
felt that flatmate is also a little bit lost and misunderstood in life so they
exchanged banter about who is more clueless in life.
</p>

<p>
everybody was happy with the arrangement, everybody liked each other. there were
no quarrels, group members did not annoy each other. nobody was the party type
person so everyone had sane waking hours. days, weeks, months passed. boy
continued to have great relationship with girl along with great sex life.
however boy still did not really feel that his fantasies were fully met. he was
still in his first love&apos;s high, he was happy enough so he did not mind that
much. he kept consuming porn to make up the void. as summer approached, the
outside temperature kept rising. the apartment was cheap because it lacked a few
things like air conditioning. it was quite hot inside as well. everyone was
sweating like pigs. boy started hanging out in his underwear. flatmate started
hanging out in a bikini swimming suit too. girl and sister did not really like
dressing down so they kept themselves fully clothed. they did not mind others
hanging out half naked. boy liked the lack of air conditioning because he liked
what he was seeing: a barely covered body of a close friend. boy was confused
though. he was looking at forbidden fruit. he did not know what to do so he just
discretely feasted his eyes on flatmate&apos;s body. as the rapport between boy and
flatmate grew, they became more playful with each other. boy&apos;s favorite game was
a tickling battle. boy could touch flatmate&apos;s in a playful matter. it was
exciting for him. at the same time this was not sexual so there was no anxiety
about doing the wrong thing in this play.
</p>

<p>
a year passed, boy liked his situation but he still felt unfulfilled. he wanted
more intimacy. he wanted to show and see more. boy learned from flatmate that
she did not really like to be nude. she does not have a problem with others
being naked around her although she is not that keen into being around naked
people. boy asked girl if he can hang around naked around flatmate. girl was not
comfortable with that so she said that he should not. boy respected her request.
this bugged boy. he really wanted to open up his body to flatmate. he wanted the
flatmate to validate his imperfect body. out of desperation he started to act in
a very creepish ways. he tried to sit in ways where his underwear does not fully
cover his crotch area, to make it look like his penis accidentally slipped out.
he wanted flatmate to catch his wardrobe malfunction. it was not terribly
effective. he was not even sure what he was trying to achieve. the tickling
battles and other games did continue, especially when only two of them were at
home. this started to became harder and harder for boy. boy was so obsessed
about flatmate that whenever they started playing, boy got an erection. boy was
super shy about this. he felt that he has to hide this from flatmate lest she
thinks boy wants sex and then she distances herself from boy. boy often had to
hold back in the games until his erection passed and only then continue playing.
hiding his thoughts, his body and his bodily reactions from flatmate felt wrong
but he did not want to make the whole thing weirder as it was already. he had it
way too good, did not want to risk pushing his relationship with flatmate
further.
</p>

<p>
boy finished his university studies at the end of his fifth university year. he
went working full time. his workplace insisted that he goes for a 3 month
training at a very far away place, a different continent even. he did not want
to go because he was not keen on going to strange places alone. he did not want
to leave his group either. workplace insisted that boy goes. he also worried
that this will worsen his relationship with girl. however girl assured boy that
3 months is not so much time, they will be fine as a long distance couple, the
job is probably worth it in the long run. boy reluctantly agreed to the
training. he packed up, said his goodbye, hopped on a plane and flew away.
workplace arranged a private hotel room for accommodation. although around this
time internet was already ubiquitous but not smartphones, the time difference
between his new place and his old place was quite a lot so synchronous
communication methods like instant messaging and videochats were not convenient.
he relied on emails for communication. he started one thread with girl and one
thread with flatmate. his work training was quite boring and boy was not
interested in sightseeing either. outside work he just spent his time alone in
the hotel room. he did not have much to say to girl. the email exchanges they
had were quite short and to the point. mostly just status updates and long
distance word hugs. that is how the email thread with flatmate started too.
however in flatmate&apos;s case he had a lot of undisclosed thoughts. now that boy
was far away and the fact he had started working professionally, started his
adult life, he thought maybe he has not much to lose. at worst he could just not
go home at all. he wanted to dump all his thoughts on unsuspecting flatmate in
email. boy found the email medium much easier to deal with. he can slowly think
through what he wants, write it down and then just press a button when he is
ready. things he would not have guts to say in person was now possible to
communicate through email. this was his fantasy after all. to completely open up
to another person. boy wrote an email and sent it. he messed it up.
</p>

<p>
boy did not thought his emotions and thoughts through. he dumped them on
flatmate in raw, undigested form. flatmate had no chance making sense of them.
he made flatmate deal with his feelings. she was angry at boy about this
irresponsible way of communication. she was was fine with boy feeling emotions
and working through them with her but he should take responsibility for them.
she tried explaining this to boy repeatedly but boy did not get the message. in
the emails boy explained that he is attracted to flatmate and would like to be
with her but he also liked what he had with girl. he did not understand what
this feeling was and what should he do now. he was sort of expecting flatmate to
come up with a solution for his dilemma. for him everything, including his
emotions had to have rational explanations. he went on trying to come up with
all sorts of silly rationalizations of his feelings, cost benefit analysis of
the various solutions, all sprinkled with many self depreciation comments. he
presented all this like if flatmate and girl were just pawns in boy&apos;s
calculations for maximizing his life happiness. all this was unfair and
insulting to flatmate. he wrote long walls of nonsensical text and thus made
flatmate angry. eventually boy apologized in his own, nonsensical way of writing
which flatmate accepted after she realized she cannot talk much sense into boy.
they did not talk much about this topic afterwards.
</p>

<p>
the 3 months slowly passed and boy was back in apartment. he did not like
keeping secrets so he explained girl what he did without going into too much
details. girl was not amused but since he did not actually do anything sinful,
she did not get angry, she appreciated the honesty. girl always trusted
flatmate, she knew flatmate was also just a victim to boy&apos;s craziness, she did
not get angry at her either. the relationship between boy and flatmate got a bit
colder but they remained friends. they did not talk about the emails afterwards
as if they wished they never happened.
</p>

<p>
another year passed. boy had a good job. he did not like it very much but he
understood that he would like other places even less. nevertheless boy
interviewed at another prestigious multinational company in a far away, western
country. he did not think much of it at first but he managed to get an offer to
work there. boy heard only good things about this company and the offered salary
was also much higher than his current one. but it also meant leaving behind the
apartment. girl was a little bit reluctant to go too. the prestige, money and
the experience of a foreign country was attractive. boy was leaning on going.
girl asked boy to marry her already and then she will go with him.
</p>

<p>
boy understood girl wanted marriage for a while now. for boy marriage was just a
technicality but he understood it meant a lot for girl. he wanted to have family
with girl so he did not really have objections against it except for one thing.
he felt that he had way too little part of his fantasies fulfilled and with girl
he will not ever be able to fulfill those. he feared that later he might get a
chance or find a way to fulfill some of those fantasies in ways girl would not
fully approve of. he might even want to have sex with others. he was feeling a
big void in his life and he could not bear the idea of locking away the full
human experience forever. he cannot marry girl if he is kept on a leash. girl
was sad to hear this. girl&apos;s heart was limitless though. he heard boy. girl said
he does not want boy unhappy. if he is honest with her, they can work through
this even if it meant boy having his crazy adventures. boy was happy to hear
this and agreed to the marriage. they quickly married privately without any
pompous ceremonies. then they packed up and left for the greener fields.
</p>

<p>
in the new city boy and girl rented a nice two bedroom apartment and the two of
them lived alone. boy was spending most of his time at work, girl was learning
the new language. during evenings and weekends they spent their time at home
watching movies or just generally being lazy since boy continued to show
complete lack of interest in leaving his home. boy was missing their previous
arrangement. he suggested that they should get flatmates again in the hopes
things will get more fun again. they understood that their relationship with
their previous flatmates was very good and it is unlikely that any new roommate
will be the same. the previous flatmates were not picked randomly, they knew
them well, girl even lived with one of them for a while. they wanted the new,
stranger flatmates only for short stays just to be on the safe side. girl was
quite the social butterfly. she quickly managed to build up a small social
network for herself mostly consisting of expats from her country living in their
new city. she could find roommates through her social network, she never needed
to formally advertise the free room. their new apartment was more modern. each
bedroom had its own bathroom and shower room and the bedrooms connected to the
living room directly. no longer was the case that people had to go through each
other&apos;s private room multiple times per day. each person could have its own
undisturbed privacy if they wanted to.
</p>

<p>
many years passed. boy and girl lived more or less happily. they had many short
term flatmates, men, women, couples. for boy none of them felt like what he
before. he socialized very little with any of the new flatmates. boy spent most
of his time in the living room where he installed his computer. a lot of the
flatmates spent their time in their private room. boy had very little contact
with them. he could not really connect with anyone. it turned out that there
were more benefits for boy in their previous arrangement than boy initially
suspected. in the old apartment the door between the two bedrooms was always
open. anybody could enter the other room any time and they even had to do so
occasionally just to move around in the house. everyone trusted each other so
well that this was not a problem. if someone needed more privacy, they went into
the bathroom. boy and girl had a curtain around their bed. though boy did not
really care, girl felt comfortable like that, especially during sexy times. the
other magical part was that each bedroom had two inhabitants who talked a lot
with each other. boy and girl heard what flatmate and sister are talking and
vice versa. as boy listened in on these conversations, he learned a lot about
each person&apos;s personalities without actually having to participate. he could
even tune out any time without repercussions in case he did not feel like
listening to others. through this boy felt more connected to his flatmates and
as such he felt it easier to have small talk with them later on. with the
constant back and forth walking through the apartment he was even forced to have
the occasional small chat. this tremendously improved boy&apos;s social skills. all
this was unavailable in his new environment. he could not connect with the new
flatmates. nevertheless boy still wanted to keep trying new flatmates.
</p>

<p>
boy was not happy. to escape his sadness he doubled down on his porn. his porn
continued to be softcore. all he cared is looking casual nudity and imagining
himself in situations where he can share his casual nudity with others and be
accepted like he is. whenever nobody was at home, he was looking at porn and
masturbating. he masturbated a lot. like most addictive behaviors, it did not
help. he became sadder and just masturbated more. he did not think much of this
at first. as the addiction spiraled and as he was spending all his time on
masturbation he started to get more introspective. maybe all this sadness of his
is due to porn. he never really liked the fact that he is masturbating. he tried
to wean himself off of it in the past but he never succeeded. he decided to quit
it for real this time. it was hard. he had many false starts. eventually he
succeeded. he managed to wean off porn and stay free of it for almost a year. he
did not even masturbate, all he had is the sex with girl. boy&apos;s mood recovered.
during that time he was not depressed anymore but he still felt a void in his
life. he still felt that he needs more to be fully happy. eventually he did not
see much benefit of being fully off porn, so he started looking at it
occasionally again. however he learned to have self control. he consumed it
rarely and he appreciated it like an expensive fine wine.
</p>

<p>
time passed. a new flatmate was coming. it was girl&apos;s childhood bestie. she was
coming for a few months to study language. boy was looking forward to this new
roommate because he already knew her. girl forced boy to meet her a long time
ago. boy knew that bestie is quite a friendly and easygoing person. maybe he can
connect a little bit better with her. bestie started living them. girl and
bestie talked a lot with each other. passively listening to these conservations
helped boy get to know bestie. she spent a lot of time in the living room, or
when she went to her bedroom to study, she left her door open. boy had a lot of
chances to practice small talk which he did. he got comfortable around bestie.
</p>

<p>
it was summer. summers in the new country were quite cold, people were not
really sweating. boy&apos;s living room had large windows instead of walls. when sun
shined, it could get quite hot nevertheless. to compensate boy tried to wear as
little clothes as allowed. when alone or only in girl&apos;s presence he was often
completely nude. he liked being nude because he did not want to hide himself. on
the contrary, he wanted to show off himself so that the world accepts him as he
is even if it meant sometimes feeling a bit cold. boy was comfortable around
bestie so he told her he likes to be nude. he then asked if he can be nude
around. bestie said she does not mind nudity but maybe he should not. girl said
the same thing. this time had the courage to understand this as a yes. he
thought they might be uncomfortable with this but they will survive if he does
this. this was big step for boy. this meant bestie would be the second trusted
person on earth to whom he could show himself fully naked. he always wanted to
do this even with others but this was the first time he gained enough courage
over time to actually act on his desires. before this time he was also concerned
about his circumcision. by this time he learned that it was not a big deal. in
fact, it made him wanted to show his penis even more. accepting his imperfect
body would have meant even greater respect than accepting a perfect one. boy
started out hanging out nude in front of his computer. one day he acquired the
courage to walk to the kitchen nude for a glass of water in front of bestie.
bestie was very casual about it. she did not even flinch, mind or even give him
much attention. boy started walking around naked even more. bestie continued to
act casually. girl was a little bit uncomfortable with this but she let boy live
his fantasy out. this was exciting for boy. there he was, naked, and people
accepting him. sometimes it was a little bit too exciting him. in those cases he
had to go back to his computer corner and wait a bit to cool down. he wanted to
show off his erection too so people accept his even more private and shameful
aroused state too. that would mean even deeper acceptance. however he was not
comfortable with that yet. although it was exciting for boy to be naked in
bestie&apos;s presence, bestie never acknowledged him the way boy wanted. she never
visibly looked at his penis, she never made any comments or questions about his
penis. boy wanted to know if bestie noticed his circumcision and if she accepts
him even like that. boy did not push the conversation further since bestie had a
fiancé at home. he did not want to create any drama due to misunderstandings.
one afternoon bestie had a terrible headache. boy offered a back massage. bestie
gladly accepted, she loved massages. she lied down on the sofa, took off her
shirt and bra in a private manner so boy had an access to bestie&apos;s fully exposed
back. boy knew that if he is nude he would not be able to go through this
without an erection so he put his underwear back on before working on bestie.
all this happened in girl&apos;s presence so boy did not feel dirty doing this. boy
massaged until girl finished cooking their dinner, about 15 minutes. afterwards
bestie said she quite liked the massage, boy had good hands. as time went on,
boy was getting more and more comfortable around her. however bestie&apos;s planned
return slowly approached. boy continued to hang out nude to get his fantasy fix
until bestie leaves. the time came. bestie packed up, said her goodbye and left
without ever acknowledging boy&apos;s penis. boy and girl was alone again.
</p>

<p>
boy was a bit happier than before. he had the chance to physically open up to
another person. however this time he missed the emotional openness. boy remained
unsatisfied. one experience remained in his mind. bestie complimented him on the
massage. he was wondering that if he could massage people he might have more
chance to fulfill his fantasies. he wanted to see flatmate&apos;s and bestie&apos;s naked
bodies. he never had the chance. he did not only want a glance, he wanted to
study them, really immerse himself in their bodies not sexually but with
curiosity. he thought that through massage he could study other bodies and maybe
connect with others. he talked through this with girl who liked the idea of boy
learning massage and even found a nice class for him to learn relaxation
massage. boy signed up and started attending the sessions. it was different from
what boy expected. about a dozen of people attended the class and most were
women. there was only one other man. first half of each session was a classroom
study of anatomy. the instructor talked through a slideshow while the students
made notes. she was teaching muscles, bones, skin structure, various diseases,
indications and contraindications of massage. the second half was more exciting
since it was about practicing the massage on each other. this is what boy was
excited about. the excitement flattened when he learned how the instructor
massaged. she always told the clients to keep the pants and bras on, she only
did back and legs, she avoided massaging the chest and stomach area because
that&apos;s more sexual to her than relaxing, and she draped aggressively. the
students had to follow her teaching. when some girls went to the changing room
to dress off and took their bras off so that people do not need to fuss around
with their bras, the instructor asked them to put them back on. this way the
sessions were quite boring for boy. there was not the slightest chance that he
will see anything exciting. he liked the touch, he just did not find the
intimacy he was looking for. the massage course consisted of 8 sessions, one
session every other saturday. one of the requirements for the massage
certificate was to do case studies. he needed to find clients, massage them and
then write a report about the session. since he did not know anybody, he asked
girl to arrange clients from her social circle. she did so. boy did not want to
stray off the protocol, he did the massage the way he was taught. clients kept
the underwear on and boy draped them well. he did not mind doing the massages
but he did not get his fix from it. he did not know most of his clients either.
boy was not good at small talk so he let girl talk with them before and after
the massage, boy just did the massaging. boy never asked anything in exchange.
he did them for free with the story that he needs them for his case studies.
clients reported that they liked the massage. he even had a handful of repeat
clients. it was hard for boy to justify why clients should come again. he had
his case study about them the first time they came. if they were to come again,
there was no easy way for clients to feel that they paid for the service. boy
did not want to ask for money because seeing and touching bodies was all the
payment he needed.
</p>

<p>
there was one lady who really liked the massage. she came back many times. boy
did not want money so she usually brought cookies. one day boy suggested that he
wants to do stomach side as well. lady did not object so boy started massaging
that part too. boy also came up with the idea that a massage should cover the
buttock area too since there are many muscle endings there. lady did not object
to that either. whenever boy was massaging the back, he also pushed down the
pants a bit so that he better access that part of her body. one day her adult
daughter came for a massage too since she was curious to see what this massage
was like given her mother went to boy so often. both lady and daughter had
attended some massage courses in their past but neither of them was actively
massaging. after the massage daughter gave some tips to boy how to improve his
game. she showed him improved draping techniques and she suggested that boy
could massage the whole chest area too, even for ladies since that is how she
learned. boy really liked this tip. boy hoped that daughter will return so that
he can practice on him. she never did but lady did. boy told what daughter said
and lady did not object. he told lady she might as well be naked, boy will drape
her well. lady was naked under the sheets. boy was happy. an exposed lady was
under her hands, covered by the sheets, trusting boy that he will not abuse his
position. boy did everything the way he learnt. he followed the draping
technique meticulously, lady was never exposed. when boy got to chest area, he
uncovered lady, fully exposing her bare chest. boy was even happier. there was
lady in front of him with even more trust in him. boy massaged the chest but
avoided the breast area because he was not sure he can touch that area or not.
when the massage was over, the magic ended. he covered her up and left the room.
lady reported that she enjoyed the massage. she came back many times afterwards.
boy enjoyed working on her. boy wanted a bit more so he tried pushing his luck.
he asked if he could use looser draping in her crotch area in the private hopes
that he can catch a glimpse of her private area. to boy&apos;s dismay lady said she
preferred the ordinary draping. boy continued doing the same massage the same
way and lady continued coming back for a while. then the frequency of visits
started dropping, eventually she stopped coming. in the early sessions when lady
was still a bit uncomfortable about what is expected in return, boy suggested
that she does the massage she learned on him. lady said it was long time passed
since she done it last time but she agreed. when the time came, she said that
this massage is done naked. boy was happy to hear that. he was expecting that he
can fully expose himself to someone. she draped well so boy did not had the
chance to show his penis off. boy liked the massage nevertheless. she did a
quite involved massage, requiring a lot of strength, boy understood why she
stopped doing it. boy was doing his massage on the floor but lady&apos;s massage
required a massage table which was a bit involved to transport over. a while
later boy asked for this massage again but lady refused, she really did not want
to do these massages so she kept just bringing cookies.
</p>

<p>
time passed. boy kept thinking about satisfying his curiosity. one thing that he
remembered sometimes is his experience with friend. he liked the trust he had
there. boy realized since he is not really looking for sex, he does not
necessarily need women to have deep connections with. he expanded what he is
looking for. he found a male nude yoga group. it sounded weird but it might
worth a shot, he thought. he signed up for a class and went there. there were
dozen of other guys. everybody disrobed, so did boy. he liked the feeling of
being nude in front of others. he took a quick glances at other people but he
did not feel comfortable staring so he did not. the yoga itself was in a
darkened room, the exercises were quite rapid, so he did not spend a lot of time
staring at others, nor did others visibly stare him. after the exercises there
was a communal shower. there were two shower rooms. one fit three people, the
other only two. boy was one of the last people showering in the two people room.
the thought of boy was showering fully exposed in the presence of another person
was somewhat exciting for boy. he got a anxious that he might get an erection
and how embarrassing that would be. to be safe, he quickly finished his shower,
left the shower room, dressed up and went home. he did like the experience but
it was not as satisfying as he expected. he did not connect with other people.
for that he needs to repeatedly expose himself to the experience. however the
group is quite far away from his place, quite late, and requires payment, all
giving an obstacle for boy. he never went again. not because he did not want to
but rather it required way more effort and planning than he was comfortable
with.
</p>

<p>
time passed again. there was not much excitement in boy&apos;s life. over time he
thought of many ideas but he never really acted on any of them. he always had
some excuses. he thought of going to a nudist beach. his problem with this was
the same as with the naked yoga. he did not really like the idea of going to
beach on its own. he could not even recall when was he last time on any beach.
passively staring at nude people would not give boy his fix. it might make him
even more annoyed having everyone exposed, yet not being able to connect with
people due to his social anxieties and general lack of ability to talk with
people. he would need to repeatedly go before he finds the right set of people
he can connect and hang out with naked. repeatedly going to a nude beach was
infeasible for him because he lived in a cold and very religious country that
did not have public nudist groups. he did not want to go alone either. girl did
not really like the idea of going to nudist beaches. she was not opposed to
clothing optional resorts but she preferred not to if she had a chance. boy
never pushed this idea further. boy also thought of using escort services. even
with girl&apos;s approval, he could not do it. he does not like going to a stranger&apos;s
place, paying large sums of money for connection. he would not feel it genuine.
the temporary connection he would get would be over after the session. boy wants
a lasting connection. a friend with who he could talk for hours, maybe through
email. he then thought of finding email penpals. he found a few people on online
forums with whom he started talking. he started threads with more people but
only a few of them had a style and content resonating with boy. he slowly opened
up with those and started sharing very personal thoughts. as the length of the
letters grew, the email threads he had slowly died off. he did not want to push
others to keep the discussion since he did not even know who the others were.
although he did not talk about it, boy wanted to know the people in real life
even if he only talked to them through emails. he wanted to be sure that in case
he fully opened to the other person emotionally, he had the chance to open up
physically. for boy talking with distant strangers on the internet meant that
there was a very little chance for the latter. he thought of using dating sites
instead. he did sign up for a free site in the past but the fact that he had to
start discussions was quite daunting for him. he never felt comfortable
initiating. he always closed his accounts after long periods of inactivity.
</p>

<p>
time passed again. boy and girl started approaching their thirties. girl wanted
children. boy was not that keen on the idea since that meant giving up a lot of
his freedom. he feared the amount of time and effort the child will need. he
feared the chance of having a high attention child. girl insisted. nevertheless
boy wanted to keep girl happy. boy agreed to the idea of children and a year
later they had their son. boy wanted to avoid being a bad father. he wanted to
ensure when he is at home, he never ignored son. son turned out requiring a lot
of attention. boy had to hold and carry son a lot to calm son down, to stop him
from crying. boy was happy to do that. he started spending less time on his
computer. he did not mind that, since he was mindlessly consuming the internet
most of the time anyways. when the initial shock of the new baby subsided, boy&apos;s
desire for more connection and sexuality in his life was back on his mind.

[to be continued, maybe.]

<h2 id="blogging">blogging</h2>
<p>
i guess almost all bloggers write a meta post about blogging where they either
explain why they blog or why others should be blogging. well, better not to
stick out of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
sometimes a thought or idea gets into my mind and unless i talk or write about
it, it keeps pestering me. writing about my thoughts really helps me organize
them a little bit. it calms my mind. having them outside my brain means that i
do not need to worry about losing a thought so i can calmly forget about it. it
is important to have an audience though. without it i would not be motivated to
keep the sentences even remotely coherent. it forces me to think really hard on
how to express some of these pesky thoughts in somewhat sane way. but often i do
not really have an audience. or even if i did have one the thought is so long
that it would be rude to send someone an unsolicited wall of text. so i thought
i write to an imaginary audience, in a somewhat secret place on the internet
that nobody reads. the possibility that someone will read this forces me to
write in a somewhat clear way.
</p>

<p>
most of the stuff i write is just crappy ideas or silly thoughts. better out
than in as the saying goes, no need to take my writing seriously. i do not think
that on my deathbed i will be agonizing over the fact that i was stupid on the
internet. more likely scenario is that i did not dump everything from my brain,
i still feel like there is some unfinished business i have to do. dumping
everything here helps me achieve my little nirvana sooner. now all i need to do
is to gather the courage and start writing. i have more than enough silliness to
write about, i just get overly anxious what my non-existent audience will think
of me. not forcing myself to reserve time for this is not helping either.
</p>

<p>
so that is about me. why should others blog? i do not follow many blogs but i
would be super interested in reading blogs of some of the people around me i
personally know. i am very reluctant to initiate towards people but i could
learn more about the person through their words. i could learn how they think,
what do they think about the world, what do they do in general and so on. i will
see a personality behind the face. i am not interested in reshares or likes
though. that is very low quality signal about the person. i really wish for
short article format, not twitter sized thought bites. if people want to point
to an article, i would much prefer if they would rewrite articles in their own
words rather than linking to an existing article saying &quot;hey follower, read
this&quot;. there are a lot of rotten links on the internet so such posts consisting
only of a link would be worthless after a while. the blogger&apos;s personality will
flow into the rewrite so even if something is not an original idea, i will still
see the issue from the blogger&apos;s point of view. it also demonstrates that the
blogger actually read the article not just blindly resharing something they have
seen on the internet.
</p>

<p>
i also prefer if bloggers did not have any tracking, commenting or other
popularity counting widgets on their blog. this is why it is better to run one&apos;s
own blog rather than relying on shared services like facebook and whatnot where
one cannot even turn off these features. the problem is that if the blog starts
to get popular the blogger will start to care about popularity. they will be
more likely to write posts that get the most attention rather than what they
actually think. they will either moderate themselves, become less radical, more
mainstream, more boring or they will swing into the opposite direction where
they will get super radical and all their posts will be about outrage. if one
does not have any analytics at all, they are less likely to fall into this trap.
</p>

<p>
a comment about publicly visible comments: it is very easy to get demotivated or
get argumentative when posting very controversial or unpopular thoughts and then
reading the comments. i think it is easier to open up if one does not need to
spend rest of their energy on arguing with others after posting something
personal. if a post generates significant response then i would rather see a
followup post summarizing the private response than wade through all the
comments. this really helps to keep the content of the blog linear. it should be
possible to read a blog just like a book. i think it is best to keep discussions
on sites that are specialized for this and as such have moderation and other
means of maintaining civility.

i like to daydream about stuff i would do in particular situations. that does
not mean that actually want to do said stuff though. i just want to play with
the thought. today&apos;s topic is what would i do if i owned a big, enclosed,
private, empty space in the middle of a city? something like a 20 person
conference room. an apartment with a huge living room but no kitchen or
bedrooms. this would be at a different place from what i call home. i could rent
it, sure. but that is boring. what would i do if i had to make use of it myself?
what events would i organize in it?
</p>

<p>
there are many crazy ideas to choose from! the first idea that pops into my mind
is to create a place for videogame lan parties. i do not like the modern,
isolating online gameplay but lan parties can be pretty fun because you know the
people you frag, you can see their face when you frag them. i could even install
a projector and play crew or bridge simulators like artemis. but maybe i would
restrict the games we can play to the ones that run on a raspberry pi. all the
gaming machines would be only raspberry pi machines. i guess not many people
would be interested in playing but the ones that would be interested are
probably somewhat similarly crazy as me so i would find it more fun this way.
</p>

<p>
it would be also fun to build something together with a small team (also only
working on raspberry pies just for the sake of it). we could gather every now
and then and build random game or website in a hackathlon style. the projects
could be about reimplementing modern tools and games to be super efficient so
that they are so fast that you could use them on a raspberry pies.
</p>

<p>
hmm, let me go full crazy mode while at this. as i hinted in a previous post i
have some issues around sexual expression, intimacy and so on. although i keep
searching for it, i cannot find events in this area that would spike my
interest. maybe i could start organizing events in this space. i have bunch of
ideas. i do not necessarily like them all the same but i would totally try some
of them.
</p>

<p>
my first idea would be to create a nude gym. is it not the case that the ancient
greeks used to train and compete completely nude? there is some sort of magic to
this. in my fantasy these events have a relatively stable set of people rather
than different set of strangers showing up in every session. i think nudity
boosts the intimacy between people which deepens friendships and respect between
ourselves. being in a friendly and respectful environment can be very motivating
in achieving our goals. also i just like to look at naked bodies, especially if
they are well and fit. if the cost of this is that i have to train next to them
then i think that is a cost i can gladly pay. by myself i have zero motivation
to do any physical exercises.
</p>

<p>
my next crazy idea is a &quot;grooming exchange&quot;. i like to be clean and shaved most
of the time. but shaving is such a boring activity. what if i had to shave other
people and other people would shave me? i do not have problems with seeing or
touching bare bodies. i think doing such things together would be quite fun.
people can chat and bond while shaving or whatever special grooming the other
person requires. and i would even feel some sense of accomplishment that i
managed to make someone else&apos;s life a little bit easier.
</p>

<p>
i feel that there is a lot of shame in people around their bodies. they feel
that it is something to be ashamed of, something to hide. i think that is
nonsense and in fact i swing way too much into the other direction: the bodies
should be actively shared and exhibited. so my next idea is about trying to
reduce the shame around nudity and help with the body acceptance. this would be
a group activity. each participant goes in front of the group and completely
disrobes. then each audience member describes the person&apos;s body in a very
neutral and objective manner. the point of the exercise is to disassociate
ourselves with our body features and body flaws. it does not matter how our body
looks like. having others objectify our body helps us treat our body as a tool
to for achieving our goals rather than an end in itself. hmm. i am not entirely
sure about this one. it might be a useless exercise. but i think it would be
still interesting to give this idea a try.
</p>

<p>
or how about a masturbation club? it is pretty clear to me that there is a lot
of private masturbation going on in a lot of folks lives. but why does this have
to be such a private thing? what is it about it that makes it so disgusting that
we do not do it together? i think once we accept our bodies, our feelings and
the fact that we are not all that different from each other, this activity can
become an okay thing to do together. sure, the first few sessions would be
totally weird but once the initial shock wears off, it becomes a normal thing.
there are several ways to do this, i think it really depends on the folks
involved how they want to do it. the participants just can sit in a circle and
have a go at it. maybe they want to watch some videos on a phone or laptop
during session, that is okay. maybe they just want to watch others, that is okay
too. the other benefit of doing this regularly is that this can defuse the
obsessiveness of this act. one of the reasons for all the uncontrolled
masturbation is that sexual gratification is pretty much random: you might or
might not get some gratification based on other people&apos;s mood and your luck.
masturbation is just a coping mechanism against this randomness. i think if i
can get gratification regularly, the need for the constant gratification
disappears. if i can get myself to masturbate only with others, i cannot go
overboard with it since i would be limited to doing it only during the
encounters.
</p>

<p>
there is this thing called orgasmic meditation. i do not actually know much
about it so let me reinvent it from scratch. this activity is done in pairs. one
person lies down on the floor and the other person is stroking or otherwise
stimulating the first person&apos;s genitals in a very simplistic manner for a long
time without any changes in the stimulation pattern. i quite like this picture.
the stimulator&apos;s job is very simple: just keep doing what they are doing. there
is no performance expectation. the person on the floor can relax, daydream.
orgasm is not the point here. i can compare this against a massage. for instance
an ordinary back massage can get boring after a while, especially if it is the
same movement over and over again. massage requires constant adjustments,
changes in stimulation and so on so it is hard to get fully relax into it. and
even if one relaxes into it, they might fall asleep which somewhat suggests that
it was boring. but i can imagine it is somewhat different with genitals: in
general i think genital stimulation takes much much longer time to get to the
boring stage. more importantly genital stimulation sort of turns on one&apos;s mind
(it fills it with sexual thoughts) so they will not simply phase out but can
actually consciously enjoy the quiet time. i think doing this in a group is
beneficial because then because the people can swap partners all the time so the
novelty factor keeps people interested in the activity.
</p>

<p>
now let me fantasize about more sexually explicit activities. i do not have much
sexual experience outside my primary relationship but i am not particularly
seeking such activity either. that is mostly because of a combination of me
being lazy and shy. however i do yearn for some extra experience. so i am
thinking of a &quot;guided sexual encounter&quot;. this would be ideal for super shy,
non-communicative and submissive people like myself. in this activity you bring
or are matched with a sexual partner. each person writes some preferences,
no-nos and other notes onto a slice of paper and gives it to the guide. the
guide reads the preferences, thinks of a scenario and starts suggesting actions
to do for the participants. all the participants have to do is just simply
follow the instructions. instructions could be something along the lines of
touch here, massage that part, stroke faster and so on. there is no performance
anxiety since the participants can project that onto the guide. this activity
does not really require a group unless the activity guided is a group sex
itself. but still, i suspect doing stuff together, even if it is silly stuff,
can be a great fun.
</p>

<p>
in fact i could go further with this &quot;guided sexual encounter&quot; thing. how about
something like a drama or acting club? there would be a script where all members
have a role to play and they have to act out the story. i am envisioning acting
out favourite sex or porn scenes (mild ones that contain more interaction rather
than sex). the nice thing is that this allows anxious people acquire sexual
experiences in a very controlled manner. since there is a script, everyone knows
what will happen, there will not be surprises. one can mentally prepare well
ahead for the event. i am not fully sure how fun this would be or if there are
even scripts that make sense but i think there is some potential in this and
would be fun to explore it a bit.
</p>

<p>
and the most explicit fantasy is just having a sex club. i am not thinking of a
free for all group sex here but something more akin to the masturbation club.
couples or groups would come and just have their sex next to the other couples
or groups. or people can join just to watch and masturbate. at this stage this
might be a little bit intimidating even for me. but it does not sound a boring
activity.
</p>

<p>
so those would be the activities i would be thinking of organizing. couple of
notes. first, i would totally ban any food and drink consumption in this place.
food and drinks create a lot of waste, it is just simply less maintenance this
way. and besides, food and drinks is often just a passive, pure consumption
activity and i would rather avoid having such activities take place there. i
would especially prohibit alcohol and other drugs in this place. primarily
because i do not like alcohol, secondly i think it is healthier if we can blast
through our insecurities without the help of drugs. drugs can alter people&apos;s
personality, make them less controllable which is something i do not want to
deal with at my place either.
</p>

<p>
there is also a problem of where would i find people interested in such
activities. from all i can see is that most people find sex, nudity and intimacy
with strangers disgusting to even talk about. my craziest idea about this is to
create a special social network for this if one does not already exist. anyone
can join the network but in order to establish a connection with another person
(&quot;become friends&quot;) both people need to: a) have seen the other person&apos;s genitals
in person, and b) know what the other person&apos;s sexual fantasies are. the goal
for the individuals in the network would be to gather as many friends as
possible. i ask only for genitals rather than full nudity because the latter can
be hard to arrange while the former can be done in a form of a flash almost
anywhere. so people meaning to become friends can have a date, talk about sex,
flash to each other and then become friends on the network. what i want to
encourage in this network to make sexuality a normal thing to talk about. when
sex is a normal topic, people would be more comfortable telling what they like,
where their boundaries are, ask for advice and so on. i do not like the fact
that this topic feels very taboo in our society. i think being part of such a
community would then make it easier for me to find like minded people. by &quot;like
minded people&quot; i mean people who do not take life way too seriously, who are
non-monogamous, non-judging, open sexually and so on.
</p>

<p>
but obviously i am way too lazy to set up something like that. actually i would
much prefer if such clubs existed somewhere else where i could just go. although
i suspect i would be way too anxious to go to such place anyways. maybe when i
am old and retired, i might set up a club like this for the new generation. all
this remains a daydream for now.
</p>

<h2 id="timestamping">timestamping</h2>
<p>
i am somewhat on the fence with regards adding timestamps to my posts. i want my
posts to contain only the content and nothing else. i want my posts to stand on
their own with no regards to posting time. when i wrote a post is usually
irrelevant anyways. on the other hand it is nice to see a rough indication of
the age of the post. hah, this reminds me of some weirdness i used to see on
some blogger.com sites. the posts and comments would have a timestamp in the
month, day, hour:minute:second format. awesome. a timestamp accurate to the
second. the only part missing? the year. because obviously that was not as
important as the seconds. i actually seen this in a lot of such blogs. super
weird. fortunately i have not encountered this recently so i am assuming this
got fixed or i managed to avoid blogger.com blogs.
</p>

<p>
anyways, this leads me to the idea that perhaps just stamping the posts with the
year they were written would be useful. i write only a couple posts per year so
i think the year granularity is more than enough. but still, i do not want to
put this metadata spam into my post contents. i have decided to just put it onto
the /frontpage. so instead of:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /post3 baz
</li><li>
  /post2 bar
</li><li>
  /post1 foo
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i would have this:
</p>

<p>
2019 entries:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /post3 baz
</li>
</ul>

<p>
2018 entries:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /post2 bar
</li><li>
  /post1 foo
</li>
</ul>

<p>
looks a bit ugly but it does the job so i will go with it for now.
</p>

<h2 id="binding">binding</h2>
<p>
i really like reading books. i do not do it often though. it mostly happens in
batches where i read many books over a few days when i have a few days of
calmness available around me. these days i usually read on kindle. it is very
convenient, light and there is the benefit that i do not need to physically
store the books. i do not like the idea of having a bookcase of the all the
books i ever read: it takes space, maintenance (ugh, i hate cleaning) and i do
not really want others see what i read. having said all that i do occassionally
run across a physical book. usually someone loans one to me, or i just pick one
up randomly when i am at a place which has books and i have time. my problem is
that the book usability is quite bad due to the way the pages are bound
together!
</p>

<p>
for instance i cannot just open the typical book in the middle and put it onto
the desk and read it from there. it would just close itself like a spring. i
have to keep holding the pages to keep the book from closing. if i want to hold
the book in air, i often need two hands. for one hand holding, i have to roll
over one side of the book. reading the rolled side is quite annoying if even
possible. it is also very easy to break the binding. once i do that, the book
becomes more brittle, the individual papers might fall out much easier. also i
have to hold the book slightly differently depending i am reading the beginning,
the middle or the end of it.
</p>

<p>
what annoys me the most is that all those problems go away with coil or spiral
binding. one downside i can think of is that maybe books do not stack well if
bound that way. that is however not a problem for me because i do not care about
how nice a books look when stacked but about its content and ease of consuming
that content. all my notebooks are coil bound and they are convenient to use.
why is it then that most modern books are still bound with that annoying method?
i tried searching the web for an explanation and i could not find any. my only
guess is that people are so used to this horribleness that they do not even
realize things could be better. this is so annoying that if i wanted a printed
version of a book, i would try to get the ebook version, print that and coil
bind it myself. why is this so hard to do in the printing press in the first
place?
</p>

<p>
the other downside i can think of is that this way it might be harder to search
for a specific book in a bookcase since the book might not have a side with a
title on it. i am not convinced that this is a problem though. i am pretty sure
you could slide a long piece of cardboard or a plastic marker into the coil that
contains the title when you look at it from side. think of this like sliding a
pen into the coil and clipping it to it. when reading the book you pull this
marker out. whenever you finished a reading session you slide the marker back
and put the book back onto the bookcase. you can easily clip other random stuff
to the coil.
</p>

<p>
and more importantly there is no need to &quot;close&quot; the book. no need for bookmarks
or remembering page numbers. next time you pick up the book, you can start
reading where you left off. in fact all this is pretty awesome! i should totally
start my own book printing business.
</p>

<h2 id="typeshooter">typeshooter</h2>
<p>
there is this old rail shooter called &quot;the house of the dead&quot;. it is about
shooting zombies, the game takes care of moving. there is a mod to it called
&quot;the typing of the dead&quot; where the player has a keyboard instead of a gun and
has to eliminate the zombies via writing the words or sentences above the
zombies&apos; head. it sounds quite silly but it is a super fun game. just look up a
gameplay video about it to get the idea.
</p>

<p>
unfortunately there are not many typing games like that. i wonder what would i
create if i had infinite time, willpower, patience, and resources. first i would
totally create a real life version of the game. the player would need to stand
on a roomba-like moving platform. whenever the player clears an area, the roomba
would start moving to the next area. this way the game stays a rail shooter. the
zombies would also have their own roombas that would be moving towards the
player&apos;s roomba and the player has to eliminate the zombies standing on them
before they reach the player&apos;s roomba. instead of a gun, the player would have a
keyboard on themselves just like in the games and each zombie would contain a
magical killphrase that kills them when the player types it. the player&apos;s roomba
would be big enough to hold two people so even the coop part could be recreated.
this should totally exist! for extra difficulty and realism myopic people could
take off their glasses and see if they can beat the game that way!
</p>

<p>
i also wonder if one could create a competitive videogame out of this. take an
ordinary fps like quake3, would it be possible to create a typing game out of
it? in typing of the dead there is no need for movement, it is only about
typing. a game like quake3 would not be a quake game without movement and guns.
i would retain those elements. in my game idea you can freely move around. on
top of the &quot;keyboard&quot; you even have two guns that you can attack with. you
cannot kill with the guns. to kill you need to equip the keyboard and type the
enemy&apos;s killphrase where the enemy is just another player. both guns have
limited ammo but they slowly recharge over time so there is no need to pick up
ammo and such. the first gun is a shotgun and you can use this to push enemies
away so that they do not get close and or to unequip the keyboard of the enemy.
on a shotgun pellet hit the game would force a switch away from the keyboard so
that the enemy needs to start typing from the beginning again. use this gun to
create distance or to keep the enemy from typing. the other gun is a projectile
weapon. when you hit the enemy with the projectile, the game reveals their
killphrase to you. now your goal is to equip the keyboard and type it. there are
several strategies: you try to escape and gain large enough gap from them so
that they cannot attack you while you type their killphrase. strategy b is to
give up your passphrase them (allow them to shoot you) and let them start typing
your killphrase. once they start, you start typing too and you just beat them at
typing. strategy c is to get very close to them and shotgun blast them. i would
make the shotgun super effective at very close range. this would push them very
far away, allowing you to gain enough time to type their killphrase but also
very risky since they could easily hit you with the projectile from such a short
range. maybe other strategies would emerge through gameplay. note that every
enemy sees a different killphrase for you so they cannot just shout it out in
real life and have someone else kill you. also if you kill your enemy, they will
get a different killphrase for you upon respawn.
</p>

<p>
is this fun? i am not sure but i would definitely try a round. and it is
probably would not even hard to implement it as a quake3 mod. keep the shotgun
and rocket launchers and reuse them as describe above. as for the &quot;keyboard gun&quot;
i could use the built in chat mechanism. the engine would watch the messages and
if a valid killphrase appears, it kills the associated player if the killer had
the keyboard gun equipped. the fact that quake3 does not let you change weapon
while chatting is a feature in this case. upon a shotgun hit i can make the mod
switch back your weapon to the primary gun so you will need to quit typing,
change to the keyboard and start typing again. once you learn a killphrase, i
would always show it on your screen so you can mentally prepare to type them on
any given moment.
</p>

<p>
even this could be reimplemented in real life: put a big barcode on every
player&apos;s head, arms, legs, back, torso. give each player a barcode reader. i
propose barcodes since they can scan pretty fast, work well with noise, and all
you need to do is to scan a line from the other people&apos;s body. if you manage to
get close to the enemy and scan their barcode, then you grab your keyboard and
type the killphrase while hoping that you are faster than the other person.
having different barcodes for different body parts could be used to grant
different scores even. if you kill someone then that person cannot attack until
they go back to a spawnzone, scan the barcode there and enter the killphrase to
respawn. or if it is a round based game then they just leave the arena
completely until the next round. to make it apparent what is the killphrase and
who is alive and who is dead, players would mount a smartphone onto their arms
which would display killphrases and the avatars of the enemy players and mark
dead players with a cross. this way you can easily ignore dead players, they
cannot pretend to be alive and ruin the game. i assume that modern barcode
readers are wireless and can tell the smartphone the scan results so the phone
can immediately display the passphrase upon scanning.
</p>

<p>
it is not only deathmatch that could be played with this. capture the flag would
work too. get to the enemy base, scan the barcode at their base and then head
back and scan the local base&apos;s barcode to get a score. obviously this needs to
be done without a death and only one player can carry the flag at any given
moment.
</p>

<p>
keep in mind that these ideas are quite raw and need a lot of polishing. but i
think they do have a potential. it just needs a lot of playtesting to find the
fun. well, at least i cannot say i have nothing to do when i ever get to my
retirement.
</p>

<h2 id="cb">cb</h2>
<p>
so the other day i was thinking about all these nudity and exhibitionism
fantasies again. i am not sure what to do with this. i have been nude with other
people but there is always something lacking which i cannot really put my finger
on. i have not actually tried this but even if i were to upload pictures about
myself naked, i think i would not feel any satisfaction either or it would be
temporary. i think it is the same with other explicit fantasies as well. even if
one could get some satisfaction, it is usually temporary and then they need to
do something again. i think maybe if one could gamify this whole thing, it would
keep people busy enough to trick them into satisfaction. so i have an idea. and
obviously as a tech person my idea is to use more tech. and it only applies to
this niche section of sexuality, the exhibitonism.
</p>

<p>
a sidenote first: i do not think the nudist lifestyle is an answer to this. for
a nudist being nude is normal. with exhibitionism some of the kick stems from
the fact that this is something forbidden or something that society disapproves
of. there is not much sexual energy in pure nudism. also, one could get easily
banned from most places for flaunting an erection.
</p>

<p>
so exhibitionism is about flaunting yourself in front of others potentially with
some innocent sexual connotations. and i think one gets more kick out of it in
real life than doing it online. however we shall not dismiss the power of
putting oneself online too. there are two problems: where would one find a safe
place for flaunting and what would be the point of flaunting?
</p>

<p>
my idea is to create a gamified social network site just for this! anyone can
register there. the point of the game is to connect with the most people you
can. there is a rule for establishing a connection with another member though:
the two people must upload a picture of them flashing their genitals to each
other. if they have the picture, they can become friends. in other words the
goal of the game is to meet locally with as many people as possible and take
genital pictures together! once they have a connection, they can chat with each
other. as a bonus, all uploaded photos and the member graph would totally public
for an extra kick. i&apos;m thinking of naming this as &quot;crotchbook&quot;. it would be a
pun on facebook since instead of face you use your crotch as your profile
picture.
</p>

<p>
totally crazy idea, right? who would ever play this game? probably not many
people. i would totally think about trying it though in order to help myself to
get rid of any shame that society imposes on us about our bodies and sexuality.
to help me learn to ignore what other people think about me (writing stuff like
this into this blog really helps with that though). to accept my body as it is
and not to be ashamed about it (i already managed to do this though). i just
assume there might be other people like this and as such i want a little corner
on the internet for us.
</p>

<p>
i have seen some dating sites, hookup sites, nudist connection sites but usually
they are very open ended and require a lot of effort to communicate what exactly
you want and then find the right people. xgeec would be laser focused on: 1.
arrange a quick meeting, 2. pull down trousers and underwear, 3. snap a pic, 4.
upload, 5. optionally put clothes back on. when the other person approves the
pic, the pic and the connection goes public. 2 and 3 can be done in a secluded
corner of a public place. there is not much place to second guess intentions or
for worrying about what will happen because there is a script and it is very
simple. one does the deed and it is over. it has a beginning and an end. one can
feel some after satisfaction establishing a connection. the connection appearing
publicly is the stimulating feedback one might yearn for.
</p>

<p>
it motivates reclusive people like myself to get out of the house because there
is very little string attached to acquiring a connection. it also helps me build
connections since in order to do this i need to meet with other, new people. as
i explained above, one can only talk to people they already have a connection
to. i would need to reach out to my existing connections in order to arrange
meetups with new people. even this can be motivating in itself: if i arrange a
meeting for someone else i feel like i am useful, that i am providing some value
to someone else. i would probably add a helpful metadata for this though: i
would allow tagging the pictures with &quot;weak tie&quot; vs &quot;strong tie&quot;. one would have
weak ties with people they do not know, they only met for the pic. strong ties
mean that the other party is a friend, they talk and stuff. when browsing
profiles, i could then see who could arrange a meeting with my target person: i
would be looking for a 3rd party that has a strong tie with both me and the
target rather than a weak tie.
</p>

<p>
a social network is worth nothing if there are no people on it. but i think it
would be super easy to seed this site compared to other social networks. this
site is not intended for building relationships or creating perfect profiles. it
is solely about uploading semi-naked group pictures. crypto geeks have their
&quot;key signing parties&quot;, exhibitionists could have their &quot;flashing parties&quot;.
suppose there are several folks interested in the site, all living in the same
city. i could find a small place for them where they could come to, snap a
couple group photos and then upload the pics afterwards. now the network is
seeded in that city and the members can start expanding the network via word of
mouth.
</p>

<p>
and this would be even super cheap to run. i would only allow 1 pic per profile
and 1 pic per connection. i would even aggressively downsize pics in order to
fit like 200kb since hosting high definition pictures is not the goal of the
site. furthermore i would delete all messages after 30 days so that i do not
keep stuff forever. maybe i would even delete pics after 2 years so people do
reconnect now and then. i would even delete profiles after 3 years of inactivity
so that the site is not a ghost town. i think the data for all this would be
peanuts, i could even run it on a free tier of a hosting provider. i should
totally create such a site. or even better: someone should beat me to it so i do
not have to deal with this all. this why i put all my ideas onto my blog but i
do not think anybody would ever bother with my crazy ideas.
</p>

<p>
one more observation: i think i really like this idea because there is a script
in it. i know what the game is about. i wonder if this could be generalized.
have a website that contains all sorts of weird sexual scripts that could be
acted out in a safe place. i am mostly talking about stuff that requires
multiple people since otherwise it would be about dating and hookups for which
there are a lot of sites. i talked about this in previous post but let me recap
some ideas:
</p>

<ul><li>
  nude workouts
</li><li>
  shaving clubs
</li><li>
  shared masturbations
</li><li>
  play something akin to the &quot;naked attraction&quot; tv show
</li><li>
  vanilla sex or orgies
</li><li>
  roleplaying (e.g. take a star trek porn and play it through)
</li><li>
  fetishes (servants, pain, anything)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the website would contain various such activities in which the members can
express interest. if there are physically close members with common interests,
the site would match them. it would also offer a venue for the activity that the
members could pay together in case they do not have one. something like
meetup.com but for sex stuff.
</p>

<p>
maybe there is such a website but i did not find anything like that. i think
there would be a dime a dozen of such websites if sexuality would not be such
a big deal. things are getting better over time but i think there is still a lot
of room for improvement.

<p>
i love my mom&apos;s fried chicken with fries! i want to cook my own. i know! i will
become a chef and prepare fried chicken with fries all day long!
</p>

<p>
alright, let me start immediately. the book says i need batter, oil, chicken,
potatoes. potatoes must be fried for a while so let me start cutting that! ouch
i cut my finger and there is blood everywhere. no matter, i apply a bandage a
keep cutting. i now put the potatoes into the fryer and off it goes. i prepare
the batter, cut the chicken fillets, coat them with batter, and start frying
them too. oh, the fries are ready. let me take them out of the fryer, and pour
them onto a plate. i salt them too. what is this smoke i smell? oh god, the
chicken is on fire! i did not set the gas stove correctly and it started burning
while i was preoccupied with the fries. quick let me put out the fire. i grab a
0.5 liter glass, fill it with water and pour it onto the frying pan.
</p>

<p>
my first attempt did not go well. at least i can do my next attempt in a new
kitchen. before doing that i decide to learn about this cooking more. i read
books, watch cooking shows and so on. one of the common advice i have seen is
&quot;separation of concerns&quot;. it says that i should not try to do too many things at
the same time because i will be overloaded and i will not be able to follow what
is going on. that sounds reasonable.
</p>

<p>
okay, so now i have some experience: both practical and theoretical. let me try
this again. this time i do the chicken frying first. i prepare the batter, cut
the chicken fillets, coat them with batter, and start frying them. as i am
frying i watch the stove, adjust the settings. the chickens now seem the right
color so i take them out the fryer. my fried chicken is ready! now i can do the
fries. i start cleaning so that there is nothing else on my working table that
could distract me. i cut the potatoes. no finger cutting this time. i fry them
too. i wait, i take them out, and pour them onto a  plate. yay, i am done, this
will be awesome. i serve both my chicken and fries onto a plate and start
eating. ugh. the chicken is cold.
</p>

<p>
not too bad but i see there is more to learn in the world. so i study more. i
even attend a culinary course. they show me fancy tools and methods to follow. i
learn to be more efficient. there is not much benefit of cutting my own fries. i
can buy it frozen and it will be roughly the same. i can buy pre-battered fries.
and if i am very careful i can fry both of them at the same. i still need to
separate the concerns so i make sure that i fry in the opposite corners of the
kitchen so that i do not accidentally mix up the two. feels a bit weird but
sounds totally reasonable. after the frying is done, i serve the meal and
everything is fine! i can finally enjoy the fruits of my studies.
</p>

<p>
it is time for me to enter the big world. i start working at a big company among
many other chefs. we all prepare fried chicken and chips all day long together.
i learn lot from my colleagues. they even show me more advanced tools and
methods. i can now prepare this meal even more efficiently. i can see other
people also enjoying all the chicken and fries. life is wonderful.
</p>

<p>
time goes on. i feel a change in myself. something is not right. there is no
excitement anymore. is it because i do not like chicken and fries? no, that is
not it. i clearly like it still. then how come i do not want to do this all day
long? where did all the feeling of fulfillment from cooking go?
</p>

<p>
i start looking. i look at the cooking shows. they are all the same, do not
create any change in me and they seem boring. then one of the shows catches my
eyes. it has a special guest cook. a well renowned one. it piqued my interest
because this person seemed to be full of positive energy. it turns out people
find his meals masterpieces. yet people hate his guts for a reason still unclear
to me. i watch his cooking. then watch other people&apos;s reaction to his meal. i
feel excited again simply by watching him. but why? what is he doing
differently? i watch closely. after many hours analyzing the footage i distill
two observations. first he is like a barbarian. does not use most modern tools
he could use. he is not using the robopeeler, nor the robocutter for his
potatoes, he does all that by hand. this is silly but oh well. after the judges
start eating his meal, he continues to make adjustments and suggestions how to
consume the meal! he asks questions, suggests using a little bit of salt here, a
little bit of mustard there. he is quite eccentric. it went against everything i
learned: using tools and that my job ends when i serve the food. it is odd but i
want to be like him.
</p>

<p>
okay, but not use tools? this is silly but well, let me try it. this is painful.
i am cutting my potato and i just cut my finger again. i am frying my chicken
from my own batter without a timer and i overcooked it a bit again. and the
taste is quite meh. and my kitchen is a mess again. i have to clean it. but this
is odd. i feel calmness. i actually feel good now. i made the overcooked chicken
myself. i made it with my own hands. i did not need help from the robots. it was
me who put that chicken there. without me that overcooked chicken would have
been some other generic fried chicken again. i had a deep connection with that
chicken. this is fun!
</p>

<p>
the next day i do this again. this time i feel like i should go eccentric even
more and use crisps instead of breadcrumbs in the batter. this time i did not
cut my finger nor overcook my chicken. the chicken was really special, extra
crunchy. it was awesome! how come this is not the normal way to cook this? i
tell about this to some people and i get crazy looks. they never even bother to
try it. am i just imagining that this is that good? i continue experimenting
with various other tweaks. some work, some do not but i find a lot of joy in the
process.
</p>

<p>
so far all i did is the do stuff by hand. i want to try the second observation i
have noticed. the part where i actually serve my meal to others and see them
consume it. but where could i do this? i know! at my company!
</p>

<p>
i go to my coworkers and ask if they would mind if, when nobody is around, i
would use the kitchen to create a small dish for a few interested folks after
work hours. they say nice idea, go ahead. i am happy. i decide to create
something special that i cannot create at home because i lack a special
ingredient available only at work: cheese. so instead of fried chicken, i want
to create fried cheese. people still like the idea.
</p>

<p>
one of the company policies that whenever someone is in the kitchen, they must
have a coworker there for safety reasons. the coworker buddy is ought to stop
that someone from doing bad stuff and help out if accidents happen. there is a
guy i know who is really interested in all this cooking, i talk with him a lot
about cooking, i think he will be ideal as my buddy. i warn him i will be a bit
unconventional and then grab a potato and start peeling by hand. he immediately
stops me. i am doing this wrong. i should be using the robopeeler, have i gone
mad? i explain that this is really important. we start arguing about this. we
keep arguing until i actually manage to manually peel and cut the potatoes. i
start frying them. he is quite disappointed in me by this time. then i start
frying the chicken as well. he goes insane when he noticed that i did not start
the timer. &quot;frying without the timer is bad! it is very hard to know how long to
cook without the timer. and besides, it is company policy to always use the
timer!&quot;. then he grabs my frying pan, throws out my cheese out of it and gets
his own battered cheese, starts frying it but also starts the timer. &quot;see? this
is how it is done.&quot;.
</p>

<p>
on one hand he is correct. that is how this thing should be done. on the other
hand he managed to completely kill my mood and interest in this food. it should
not matter to me if the timer is going on for my chicken yet it does. simply the
timer being there annoys me. i do not get the &quot;i made this without robohelp&quot;
feeling anymore. i am getting back to the &quot;this is no fun, this is just plain
work&quot; state. what also annoys me that he also tells me how to do *my* stuff even
though he is completely uninterested in the end product, only in the cooking
process itself. i try to to explain that this is part of the magic i need in
order to make this meal but he does not budge. i get angry, do a super quick
cleanup and leave the kitchen because i do not see any point in continuing.
</p>

<p>
i keep thinking about the next step. i could leave the whole thing and just not
try make an interesting meal for a few folks. however i cannot let one person
get to me. i think i just need to change my buddy. there is this other guy. he
is pretty busy all the time just because he actually gets work done in the
company. he does not have time for petty arguments. but i will not get any
feedback or suggestions from him either. i ask him to my buddy and he comes. as
expected, he does not give much attention to me, he is doing his own job. on the
other hand i can finish my meal in the way i want. my guests come. i do not tell
them how i made this food other than it was a labour of love. i do not want them
to run away from me when they learn that i hand peeled and hand cut my potatoes
as in all the previous cases. i sit down next to the people who will consume it.
they like it. i feel happy about this. i recommend some salt here, some
mayonnaise there. i feel the fulfillment again.
</p>

<p>
people started liking what i create but at the same time people started hating
my guts. i am no longer pleasing all the people but in exchange i feel
fulfillment in my life again. i accept this tradeoff. all i need is to have the
courage to be disliked.
</p>

<h2 id="pain">pain</h2>
<p>
pain is a signaling system. it signals that something is not right. there are
two types of pain: sudden spike and chronic pain. if you suddenly feel pain then
most of the time something changed around you suddenly and you probably even
know the reason. in this case pain is a useful signal but it can get into the
way of resolving the underlying issue. e.g. if a bear is eating my leg then i
might just give up everything because it is too painful. maybe i would fight or
run more if the missing leg would not be bothering me. so in this case making
the pain go away might be very useful.
</p>

<p>
the chronic pain is different. and by chronic i mean the one that last for very
long time. i do not mean physiological pain only but mental too. inconvenience
might be a better term for the latter. we cannot simply wish the chronic pain
away. so what do we do? we medicate ourselves with painkillers. in the
inconvenience&apos;s case we start using various tools and gadgets to make things
more comfortable. this indeed makes the pain go away so it is a reasonable
solution.
</p>

<p>
however you could look at this differently. pain is something that you are
intrinsically motivated to alleviate. what if rather numbing the pain, you alter
your lifestyle in a way that the pain is manageable? with this approach you do
not feel at mercy of your doctors and drugs anymore. you feel that you are in
charge of life. you start researching your pain. you start experimenting with
things. basically you get a goal and start living. all your actions start to
have a meaning. the &quot;why am i doing this?&quot; feeling is not around. it is not an
easy life. every day you wake up, the pain greets you. it does not allow you to
slack off. you remain passionate about alleviating your pain.
</p>

<p>
and the nice about this is that you can always inflict pain on yourself.
depressed because you are invisible and there is no point in life? start walking
barefoot on the streets. you will immediately notice trash or dog poo on the
ground. you will start moaning how all this trash and dog poo is bad for us all.
you might start picking up the trash in your immediate vicinity in order to make
it habitable for yourself or at least arrange a daily cleaning service on your
street. you start fighting for clean streets. you now matter because you want to
achieve something. and that something is only about fixing your inconvenience:
making sure you can walk around barefoot without getting too dirty.
</p>

<p>
others will think you are crazy. they will try to talk some &quot;sense&quot; into you.
get shoes or else all sorts of bad thinks will happen to you. some people will
even get angry at you. do not let them to get to you or otherwise discourage
you. do not take naysayers seriously. ignore them. you cannot achieve something
without making some people angry. let them have their boring life. yours is now
full of excitement and possibilities. focus on that. after a while you will not
even notice the pain anymore. your body adapted to it naturally. it learned that
this pain might be okay after all and decided to not to bother you anymore. all
you need to survive is the initial period of the pain. do not underestimate your
body&apos;s and mind&apos;s adapting capability.
</p>

<p>
this does not mean that you should go all out and do all sorts of crazy stuff.
it works only up to a point anyways (yerkes-dodson law). and this takes a very
special personality. most people are not up to this. there are two lessons you
can take away: 1. if you ever feel uncomfortable, maybe keep yourself in that
state just a little longer just to see what happens, 2. if you see other people
doing crazy things despite the apparent pain, do not feel superior to them. all
the nice things we have today is thanks to crazy visionaries who went against
the establishment, made a lot of people angry and sometimes even suffered a lot
in exchange. try to understand their motivations instead. try to not obsess
about what and how they are doing things but rather what they are achieving.
after all, do not we all want clean streets?
</p>

<h2 id="complexity">complexity</h2>
<p>
everybody hates complexity. yet at the same time msdp (&quot;modern software
development practices&quot;):
</p>

<ul><li>
  encourage adding complexity under the disguise of reducing complexity.
</li><li>
  discourage people from gaining the expertise to avoid complexity.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it is not done purposefully. complexity is painful. people do not want to
experience pain. so as long as people do not feel pain things are good. msdp are
like painkillers. they definitely do help not feeling the pain of complexity, no
argument there. but just because people do not feel it, it does not mean it is
not there. eventually people get so much painkiller into their system that they
cannot live without it anymore. and the eventual consequence of all this is
mental breakdown or burnout.
</p>

<p>
all software is a solution to a problem rather than an end in itself. what is a
&quot;problem&quot;? problem is a pair of states: input state and output state. there are
many sorts of problems:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i have a list of numbers -&gt; i have the average of those.
</li><li>
  i have an essay in a text file -&gt; i have the most common word of the essay.
</li><li>
  i time to kill -&gt; i am watching a video.
</li><li>
  i want to pay for the pizza -&gt; the pizzeria has my money.
</li><li>
  i am craving sugar -&gt; i have ice cream in my hand.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
software is that tiny &quot;-&gt;&quot; bit between the two states. in fact, the software
part is completely irrelevant! yet for complexity reduction msdp focus on that
tiny irrelevant part. this is what happens when people consider the software as
an end in itself. the focus should be on the problems instead.
</p>

<p>
take the first problem. it is quite abstract but for a programmer it is super
clear what it means. one can even mentally fill how the software works because
it is just that obvious. now take the last problem. it is very fuzzy and
subjective. it is unclear what the software will be between them. do we create
an online shop where people enter their feelings and we send the appropriate
item for said feeling? or do we create a software for mixing ice cream based on
how much sugar the human wants? it is super unclear what are we trying to solve
here. usually this fact does not stop people from firing up their editor and
start furiously developing stuff.
</p>

<p>
what is the difference between the two problems? the first one expresses a
problem via well known computer science terms: numbers, strings, lists. the last
problem expresses it via abstract terms that try to clearly identify the
concepts in question.
</p>

<p>
why is the software trivial in the first case, complex in the latter? in the
first case the two states are very objective. everybody agrees on what the two
states mean and can reliably tell what and what not matches those descriptions.
as such when people think how to solve the problem, they pretty much arrive at
the same solution so there are not many creative differences in its software
development process. in the latter case people cannot fully agree what
&quot;craving&quot;, &quot;ice cream&quot; or &quot;in my hand&quot; means. every person will have a different
understanding. they will have different assumptions. they will want to implement
different things. and in the middle of the development process they realize that
one team meant something completely different for &quot;in my hand&quot; than the other
team and now they are creating even more problems and software to bridge this
misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
what is the solution? the job of the software engineer is to reduce the
subjective states into the objective realm of numbers, strings and lists.
</p>

<p>
what does msdp recommend? numbers, strings and lists are unintuitive and hard,
we should abstract and create new terms. instead of &quot;list of numbers&quot; you have
&quot;grades&quot; of &quot;students&quot;. instead of &quot;average&quot; you have &quot;grade average&quot;. when you
define things like this, they start getting muddy. what is a grade? is it a
number? is it a letter? what is the grade average of &quot;a a a b&quot;? the more
abstract terms one introduces, the more muddy the problem and its software will
be. this is what i meant under &quot;msdp encourage adding complexity&quot;.
</p>

<p>
and to top it off, all the tooling msdp create are further exacerbate the
problem. it is all about object orientation, genericity and even type hiding so
that you have even less chance to understand what is going on. people are having
harder and harder time to communicate with each other just because of the sheer
amount of unclear concepts one has to hold in their head.
</p>

<p>
following this practice leads to very very long problem descriptions with many
many types of lists, strings and numbers for the various aspects of the problem.
yes. but the key observation here is that if you write all this out, then you
will see the problem&apos;s essential complexity in its natural form. it will be
ugly. it will be painful. but just because something is ugly or painful, does
not mean you should hide it. what you need to do is to learn to not mind that
ugliness. keep working with it and over time you will gain all the necessary
experience to spot and mentally chunk patterns just like professional chess
players can take a quick look at a chessboard and instantly understand the full
state (and if not then they know that things are messy and should be cleaned
up). if you are a doctor then it would be a quite weird if you would be
uncomfortable looking at dicks. no, instead the expectation would be that you
learn a lot about dicks so that you can look at any dick without problems
because that is the human body in its natural form. yet msdp recommend that you
do your best to hide all those dicks so that nobody gets uncomfortable. the
developer novices do not even have the chance to learn to recognize patterns.
they must work with new abstractions all the time. and if they break down
something too much, they are scolded that they are not following msdp. this is
what i meant by &quot;msdp discourage people from gaining expertise&quot;.
</p>

<p>
the next important task after breaking down the problem into numbers, strings
and lists is to document the mapping between the subjective and the objective
representations of the problem. even though msdp recommend doing this with all
that object oriented madness, this cannot be done formally. the only way to do
this is by writing informal prose. the writer of such mapping must meticulously
explain what each number and list represent in the subjective world. in other
words a software developer&apos;s task is not really to write software but to write
text!
</p>

<p>
this is no easy task. and why would people bother writing documentation anyways.
all the structure is super clear in their mind so the mapping between the
subjective and objective world should be super clear to everyone else too.
interestingly when most developers look back to their own code written in the
past, they think it is ugly and unnecessarily complex. in such cases the
assumption is that this is because they got smarter but that is not the case.
they would write the same code today too. the only thing they are lacking is the
context of their code. and the reason they lack it is because they did not
clearly document the input and output in simple terms. the other characteristic
of most developers is the feeling that they should refactor all the time. they
write something and they are very proud of it. then they try to actually extend
it they realize that what they wrote is not any good and they want to start from
scratch. they constantly want to reimplement things. as such their productivity
is pretty low. if you are thinking in terms of input and output then
understanding code is not hard and you do not get the feeling that your old code
is bad nor do you feel the inclination to refactor all the time.
</p>

<p>
suppose you are using linux every day. you get curious about the kernel. you
want to learn more. you download and open its source code. you barf. it looks
unnecessarily complex and think this is crazy. you even think maybe you should
write a new operating system from scratch just to show them how is it done. see
the problem? this is the &quot;software as an end in itself&quot; approach. if you open a
piece of code and say &quot;i want to understand this&quot; then you are doing it wrong.
</p>

<p>
what you need instead is a problem. you could say &quot;i have all these processes; i
want to know how can they run simultaneously&quot;. if you phrase it like this then
your first step is not to download the linux kernel source code and get
frustrated about its complexity. instead you first open the wikipedia and start
learning about processes. if you know everything about them then you start
learning about the schedulers. once you know about those, you start searching
about linux specific schedulers and you learn how do they work. at no point did
you need to open the linux kernel source to answer your curiosity. but suppose
no one is around to tell you what linux is doing. then you must download and
inspect the code. however in this case you already have the context: you know
the technical terms around both processes and schedulers. you know that you are
looking for a specific thing. you also know that this is a very core thing in an
operating system so &quot;drivers&quot; will not be the right directory. you can pretty
much tell what does and what does not look relevant to this. you find the
corresponding file and it tells you the name of the scheduler and even points to
docs. you got your curiosity satisfied without any complexity getting into your
way. all you really needed is to get accustomed to some objective terms and
concepts and then understand the problem in those terms.
</p>

<p>
software does not exist in vacuum though. it is used in a domain. if the domain
has well specified, objective terms for concepts, then using those when reducing
problems is fine. in the domain of computer system administration i work with
the following concepts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  files: contain all the data.
</li><li>
  processes: calculate all the data.
</li><li>
  rpcs: remote procedure calls for communication.
</li><li>
  machines: run the processes.
</li><li>
  users: isolate or limit the processes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if a state is expressed in these terms then i can probably understand it pretty
quickly. it is very easy for me to &quot;visualize&quot; the state in my mind. when i
visualize both the input and output state, i can sort of get a &quot;feel&quot; for what
is happening in between. if i start seeing &quot;tasks&quot;, &quot;channels&quot;, &quot;configs&quot;,
&quot;objects&quot; then things start getting muddy for me. people try to be nice and
&quot;hide the complexity&quot; but all it achieves that i am no longer able to see all
the pieces the software is working with. all i see is fog.
</p>

<p>
it might seem that some problems cannot be reduced to such simple terms. e.g. i
want to write a videogame but i do not really know what exactly the end result
will be since it will require a lot of iterations to get everything right. even
so, you still have a rough idea what you want. in a shooter you want a 3d
environment, players, enemies, weapons. you can break down those concepts into
their corresponding data structures, find some common problems that you are sure
you will encounter (moving around, collision detection), implement those, and
then go from there. the idea is that you should have a clear, objective mapping
between the concepts and their data representation in simple types.
</p>

<p>
another reason people are afraid of deconstructing things into their base forms
is that if they write out the full state like that in such simplistic terms then
it will be way too long and unhelpful. however length should not be an indicator
that you need an abstraction but rather that you need to think more to come up
with a simpler system. sometimes this is impossible: you want efficiency or good
usability and for that you need all those pieces. that is okay. in such case it
will be clear that we are trading simplicity for features. it will be also clear
when are we having way too much features and maybe start thinking in different
terms of approaching the problem.
</p>

<p>
take the case of long functions. msdp suggest that you should break down long
functions if it makes sense. this then reduces the number of local variables you
need and thus you reduce the state the &quot;poor reader&quot; has to keep in head. but
that makes no sense if you consider things from the input output perspective.
you are not reading a function for entertainment. if you are reading a function
then that means you are either trying to extend it or you are trying to find a
bug in it. in both cases what you really need is a good understanding of what
the function does. if all you see is just invocations to other opaque functions
then it will not be clearer what is happening. what you really need is a human
telling you what the function does in high level terms. when you have that
understanding, then you will also have a feeling where to put the missing piece
or where the faulty line might be. where are you going to get this if you do not
see any human around? you will get this from the comments. in other words what
you are really looking for are human comments in functions. and you need good
quality comments. how do you get that?
</p>

<p>
there is this phenomenon in in-person human communication: suppose someone is
explaining something to you. when they finish the explanation, they are looking
at you, waiting for a reaction. if you do not provide any reaction, the other
person will assume that you lost the thread and they will start explaining in
more detail. this also works with code! if you write a large chunk of code then
you will feel bad if you do not give a summary commentary in front of the chunk.
however small chunks feel obvious and as such they are left undocumented. if you
split up a large functions into many small functions, it is pretty much expected
that you will have less documentation and your code will be much harder to
understand.
</p>

<p>
good rule is this: when you see the same logic in 3 places then consider
factoring them into a function but no sooner. below 3 you simply do not know if
the abstraction you are creating is good. 3 and above it means that there is a
common concept hiding there, it might worth naming it. this process is called
semantic compression. note that this process applies when deconstructing state
too: if there are common structures (4 floats representing a vector) then it is
okay to define a structure for them (struct vector). but this structure is just
for naming a common concept, it is not meant to hide its elements or assign
functionality to them like you would do in object oriented programming.
</p>

<p>
since poor functions are one big source of complexity, let me elaborate a bit
further on them. you should treat a long function like you would treat a book.
it should start with an introduction what the function is about, what the inputs
and outputs are and then a table of contents of its logic for quick navigation.
do not use numbers for the sections because the numbers might get invalidated
quickly. make sure the heading names are unique so that the reader can quickly
navigate by text search. this does not really look nice in small examples but as
a quick demo a small example will do:
</p>

<pre>
 // return a solution to a^2*x + b*x + c = 0 (unspecified which one in case of
 // multiple results). x is an output-only variable (must be non-null). the
 // function returns true on success, false in case there is no solution.
 bool solvequadeq(double *x, double a, double b, double c) {
   // solve the equation using the following steps:
   // basecases: handle the base case.
   // discsqrt: calculate the square root of the discriminant.
   // returnres: calculate x and return it.
</pre>

<pre>
   // basecases: handle the base case.
   if (a == 0) {
     *x = -c / b;
     return true;
   }
</pre>

<pre>
   // discsqrt: calculate the square root of the discriminant. this platform
   // lacks sqrt so we implement our own approximation via newton&apos;s method.
   double disc = b * b - 4 * a * c;
   if (disc &lt; 0) return false;
   double discroot = 1;
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {
     discroot = discroot - ((discroot * discroot) - disc) / (2 * discroot);
   }
</pre>

<pre>
   // returnres: calculate x and return it.
   *x = -b + discroot / (2 * a);
   return true;
 }
</pre>

<p>
as you can see i inlined a sqrt (with the assumption that sqrt() was not
available). sqrt is a pretty well known and understood concept so it would be
okay to grant its own function. but there was nothing of value lost by just
simply inlining it given that it is only used from one place. you could argue
that this way somebody might add another sqrt or that when the platform gets its
sqrt support, nobody will replace this piece of code. now this might be true for
simplistic example, but for a more complicated example somebody would totally
reimplement frobnicate() even if a frobnicate() would have existed already (they
would call it dofrobnicate() so the compiler cannot point out this mistake to
them). and the second concern is not addressed by decomposition either. you will
still have identical pieces of code all around. and even if msdp would address
the issue of duplication, it is a moot point. remember, complexity does not stem
from duplication. complexity stems from the fact the concepts the code works
with are subjective and unclear. obsessing about duplication will not reduce the
complexity.
</p>

<p>
by the way, another trait of msdp is that they always demonstrate their points
using simple examples and for that they all seem convincing. demonstrating
complex examples is cumbersome so they never get to the point where they would
see their systems crumbling down under their own self-inflicted complexity.
</p>

<p>
some comments look superfluous in this small example just like having too many
subheadings in a small book is superfluous. i would not give this many comments
for a function like this. but for longer functions they can really help the
navigation. free form comments are much easier to read than
handle_the_base_case(). from such function name you do not know that it is
related to quadratic equations even.
</p>

<p>
if you squint enough, this is very similar to knuth&apos;s literate programming. the
difference is that in this case we do not generate a separate document for
consumption.
</p>

<p>
what would happen if you started breaking down a long function into short
functions and/or approach the problem in an object oriented programming way? the
essential complexity would still be present, you cannot eliminate that. however
it would add a lot of accidental complexity. you will get bunch of new problems.
you have to pass around state. things will look quite okay initially but it will
be a maintenance and debugging nightmare. when requirements change and you have
to tweak some functionality here and there, you will realize that you need to
pass around even more state. your function prototypes start growing bulky (and
the function names will be obsolete just as well as comments can become
obsolete). eventually you will end up in a codebase where the function splitting
look pretty much arbitrary and does not make any sense. or suppose you want to
speed up the above function. when you look at it like this, it is pretty obvious
that you can trade speed for accuracy just by decreasing the number of
iterations in the loop. you have immediately seen that. had everything been
abstracted away, such observation would have taken quite a while to arrive at.
or suppose you are trying to debug this function. you want to add print
statements here and there to dump state. if all state is available in this
single function, adding such print statements at a few tactical places is super
easy. doing the same in a heavily abstracted code is painful. the point if you
have a lot of abstractions then you spend a lot of time fighting against those
abstractions and this fighting is called the accidental complexity. this is why
all those abstraction fanboys want to refactor their codebase all the time. you
can avoid all this pain just by not abstracting at all until there is a clear,
objective benefit to it (you have at least 3 cases that you can replace with a
single concept).
</p>

<p>
another observation of the whole input output approach is that if the code does
not matter, then the choice of platform and programming language does not matter
much either. this is one of the reasons why c got very popular. it was not
trying push any methodology on people (other than the const correctness
nonsense). it implemented the basic features that people needed for structured
programming and it turned out that was enough for almost everything so it spread
like a virus.
</p>

<p>
this is getting already way too long so let me wrap up. if you disagree
everything written in this post, i ask you this: there are people who manage
complexity like this and it works really well for them. give them some space. do
not disregard their approach completely just because you do not agree. if
something is unclear when approached like this, just ask for better comments.
</p>

<h2 id="codeswap">codeswap</h2>
<p>
i am really curious how effective my &quot;avoid creating types&quot; approach would be
compared to the object oriented approach. i am thinking of creating an
experiment for it. not that i would ever conduct such an experiment but thinking
about it is fun. i am not even sure where would i get people for this experiment
but suppose that problem is solved. now imagine i have a room full workstations
next to each other like in a typical open plan office. the experiment would
involve having the participants solve a series of related programming challenges
on these machines under a time constraint. then they would need to swap their
solutions and continue working on other people&apos;s code. the swap also changes the
problem the participants are supposed to solve. there are two problems, the swap
is done a way that it changes the problem for everyone. to make sure there is no
language barrier, i would ask each participant to use the same language.
something simple, e.g. c, go or python. i would ask the participants to brush up
their language skills before coming to my test. i would also make the
environment equally bad for each participant so that the environment has very
little effect on the results. to be specific: all i would give them is just a
terminal that is split into two windows: left side runs the nano text editor,
right side runs a terminal app that shows how correct their solution is. every
time they hit save in nano, it updates the right hand side with the results. i
would split the experiment itself into the following phases:
</p>

<ul><li>
  intro phase: give participants their problems and have them read a
  motivational text how to approach the problems.
</li><li>
  design phase (30m): the participants can write code but they get no feedback
  on the right hand side yet. they are supposed to architect their solution
  during this time. nearing the end they are also expected to write a feedback
  how hard they thought the problem was or their general thoughts about the
  experiment. they can just write this feedback directly into their source code
  as free form text at the bottom, i will strip this out before compiling or
  swapping the code.
</li><li>
  implementation phase (30m): at this point the right hand window wakes up and
  starts giving feedback. if they worked well, the participants should be able
  to easily make their code compile and solve the subproblems correctly (the
  ones they have already implemented) and then just continue solving more
  subproblems. nearing the end they are expected to give feedback to the study
  at this point too. however at this point they should also leave some pointers
  what was done and what the next steps are for implementing more features. this
  should be aimed at the next person.
</li><li>
  continuation phase (60m): now the system swaps around the code. the students
  have to work with other people&apos;s code. they have to get familiar with it and
  continue working on implementing the missing features. the swapping phase also
  changes the problem so the students also need to get familiar with a different
  problem. nearing the end they should write more feedback.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i am not sure how to implement the swapping phase yet: i can either ask the
participants to swap desks, or i can make the computers shuffle the code around.
either one works. if the latter, i need to be careful to prevent participants
from saving utility functions somewhere for reuse. they should completely lose
everything they have written so far.
</p>

<p>
the two problems would be very similar when reduced to the core but they would
be phrased differently and put into different context so that it is not obvious
that it is the same thing. but at the same time the two problems must be
different enough so that the participant cannot just simply delete everything
and rewrite stuff from memory.
</p>

<p>
the motivational text would have 2 dimensions, totaling in 4 different texts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  one half says that having comments is an indicator of poor code, participants
  should design their code in a way that does not require comments. the other
  half says that comments really humanize the code, people should write a lot of
  comments to make the intent clear.
</li><li>
  in the other dimension one half says that abstraction is what keeps the code
  simple and straightforward. make the structure of the code similar to the
  structure of the problem. the other half suggests to avoid abstraction: try
  avoiding creating new types, try sticking to arrays and long functions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
after the experiment is done, i would ask them to fill a survey. for each phase
it would ask the following binary questions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  was it clear what you needed to do?
</li><li>
  did you find this task fun?
</li><li>
  did you feel productive?
</li><li>
  was it easy to work with the code?
</li><li>
  did complexity unnecessarily hindered you?
</li><li>
  do you feel you could have achieved more in a better environment?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
my hunch is that in the design/impl phase the nocomments+abstraction group will
feel the most fun, ease and productivity but the comments+noabstraction group
will get more stuff done. in the continuation phase:
</p>

<ul><li>
  nocomments+abstraction continues on nocomments+abstraction code: not fun,
  hard, unproductive.
</li><li>
  nocomments+abstraction continue on comments+noabstraction code: not fun, easy,
  productive.
</li><li>
  comments+noabstraction continue on nocomments+abstraction code: not fun, hard,
  unproductive.
</li><li>
  comments+noabstraction continue on comments+noabstraction code: not fun, easy,
  productive.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in other words: the continuation phase is not fun since people do not really
like to work on other people&apos;s code. working on non-abstract code will be much
easier and people will feel more productive afterwards. the
&quot;comment+noabstraction continues on comments+noabstractions&quot; group will have an
advantage though: if they followed the recommendation, they should have come up
with roughly the same structure so they should be more familiar with the new
codebase.
</p>

<p>
and if it turns out that is the case then i will be vindicated. most software is
just a different configuration of the same underlying concepts. there is no need
to abstract away all this but rather what is needed is learning to recognize
patterns. the professional chess example is very apt: pro chess players can
instantly recognize very complex state in the middle of a pro match. even though
they might even give some states a name (an abstraction), it is not the name
that helps them recognize the state but rather the fact that they worked with so
many different chess states so long. it is the experience that matters rather
than ensuring every little concept has its own name. in fact, take two random
pro chess players: if they talk different languages they will not be able to
talk with each other much. but show both of them the same chess board and it is
very likely that both of them will make the same next step. this next step is
obvious from the abstraction-free chessboard. yet if they cannot see the
chessboard, they will pretty much not be able to agree what should be the next
step solely because they do not know what the other person is talking about.
</p>

<p>
when working with code, all we can do is to project the code&apos;s concepts into
concepts we already know. for instance as part of my sysadmin work i often
project the software into the realm of linux system calls. i am very familiar
with those and as long as i can understand the code in terms of syscalls, i can
pretty much have a rough idea what it is trying to achieve and how. a code feels
complex when i cannot do this projection. so my recommendation is to stay on
this level, avoid creating concepts that have unclear projections onto the well
known concepts. and i am not saying to completely avoid creating new concepts.
rather only create a new concept if you have a handful of usecases (at least
three): then i can see the concept from various angles and i can learn why is it
an useful concept. otherwise it is just a like a useless signpost saying &quot;this
is a signpost&quot;.
</p>

<p>
anyways.
</p>

<p>
as for the problem: i am not sure about this yet. it needs a theme and a bunch
of small and easy problems related to that theme so the participants can solve
some of them. maybe something like this: you are managing a garden. your task is
to read the garden description and help the farmers answer a few questions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  what is the area of the garden?
</li><li>
  how many types of vegetables are there?
</li><li>
  which vegetable consumes the most area?
</li><li>
  can you render a map of the garden? (just on the console, not a picture)
</li><li>
  given the work needed for each vegetable, how much work does the farm need?
</li><li>
  how expensive is the garden to maintain?
</li><li>
  how much money can the farmer make of the garden?
</li><li>
  suggest a better, more money making plantation for next year.
</li><li>
  which two plantations are the furthest away?
</li><li>
  and a very hard one for the ultra productive people so that they do not get
  bored: can you draw a road network to connect the plantations? make sure
  everything is easily reachable but at the same time try to minimize the number
  of road cells you need.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
obviously i need to think more about this part but that is the rough idea. the
other problem could be very similar but it would be zoo themed. you would have
animals and zookeepers instead. or maybe school themed where you would have
teachers, students and grades. dunno, this is just an implementation detail.
</p>

<p>
thinking about this even gives me an idea on how to approach learning the ways
of software development if you have access to a buddy: both should start a
project each but nearing the end have the other person finish it. iterate this
(while occassionally changing buddies) until you feel confident in coding. every
time you do a swap, there is a lot of context that needs exchanging. but if you
do this often enough, over time it will be clear what sort of documentation or
coding styles you need to write or use to make your code easy to pick up. i wish
more people would be better experienced in this area of software development. oh
well. might be a silly idea but still interesting to me.
</p>

<p>
maybe if i were a university professor with lots of time on his hand, i could
conduct such experiments on my students. hmm.
</p>

<h2 id="fsbuf">fsbuf</h2>
<p>
i&apos;m thinking of keeping my filesystems mounted read only on some of my linux
computers. i sometimes do stupid stuff and not touching disk by default sounds
like a sensible way to prevent accidents. what i would prefer instead is that
the operating system keeps my changes in memory and then i can review them and
once happy, commit them to disk. this mode also ensures that my disks are always
in a cleanly unmounted state, i can just simply turn off or restart the computer
anytime without bothering with proper shutdown procedures. i&apos;m not fully
confident that i want this because it also means that i&apos;m now forcing myself to
do an additional manual sync after each piece of work. but at least i want to
know how to do it. i haven&apos;t found any good tutorial on the internet so i
thought i&apos;ll write down my findings for my own future reference.
</p>

<p>
note that i am aware that i could just use git for everything, and perhaps copy
the whole homedir to a tmpfs and then just copy back the commited files. that&apos;s
one way, but i&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s possible to solve this problem in a more
general and transparent way.
</p>

<p>
by the way, that wouldn&apos;t be the only usecase you would consider this for. maybe
you want to continue using your disk as is, but occasionally you want to make
send the changes over to a slower, backup storage. there are probably some
better solutions for this, but the solution described here would work with any
underlying filesystem without too much of a hassle and performance loss.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ll use unionfs-fuse for this. don&apos;t confuse that with unionfs which is a
kernel module implementing the same thing, and don&apos;t confuse it with overlayfs
either which is another newer and fancier kernel module implementing similar
things. only unionfs-fuse allows modifying the underlying filesystems directly
without breaking its internal structures so it&apos;s the only system i can do online
merging without too much of a fuss. sure, there are some caveats and edge cases
where it wouldn&apos;t work, but i&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s rare enough to not bother
caring. and i&apos;ll call unionfs-fuse as unionfs from now on for simplicy.
</p>

<p>
and for example&apos;s simplicity let&apos;s suppose the following directory structure:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /home: the home directory i&apos;ll be working day to day. this is the directory
  unionfs will create.
</li><li>
  /homedisk: the disk backend of the /home directory. this is the read-only
  branch for unionfs.
</li><li>
  /homebufrw: this will be a tmpfs dir containing files that i haven&apos;t committed
  to the disk yet. this will be always mounted as read-write. it needs to be
  read-write because during the sync operation the sync script will move the
  files to /homedisk and then delete them from /homebufrw.
</li><li>
  /homebuf:  this will be the read-write branch for unionfs. it is a bind mount
  for /homebufrw that we can toggle into read-only mode during syncs so that
  nothing can alter the /home filesystem during a sync operation to avoid race
  conditions. the read-only switch is not necessarily needed, but i&apos;d prefer it
  that way to ensure nothing can break my sync scripts.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
also note that most commands here assume root as runner. it is possible to avoid
using root for most mount commands using clever /etc/fstab config but that&apos;s a
bit outside the scope of this tutorial so i&apos;ll leave it out.
</p>

<p>
make sure all 4 directories exist:
</p>

<pre>
  dirs=&quot;/home /homedisk /homebuf /homebufrw&quot;
  mkdir $dirs
  chown 1000:100 $dirs
</pre>

<p>
user:gid of 1000:100 usually means the default user and the default users group.
if you already have a /home directory, just rename it to /homedisk instead.
ideally you would set this up when you are not using said home directory. e.g.
you are logged out and setting this up as root, or setting the disk up from a
different system.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ll assume /homedisk is already mounted, preferably as read only. it might be
just a vanilla dir on / in which case i&apos;ll assume / is mounted read-only.
</p>

<p>
next, mount a rw tmpfs on /homebufrw and bind /homebuf:
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o mode=0755,uid=1000,gid=100 -t tmpfs tmpfs /homebuf
  mount -o bind,rw /homebufrw /homebuf
</pre>

<p>
now, mount the unionfs. run the unionfs command as your own user otherwise you
unionsfs will create its helper files as root and that&apos;s not ideal. you won&apos;t be
able to run setuid binaries from this directory, unfortunately.
</p>

<pre>
  modprobe fuse
  cd /  # to ensure we can unmount /home no matter where we ran the command.
  unionfs -o allow_other,cow,hide_meta_files /homebuf=RW:/homedisk=RO /home
</pre>

<p>
you should now see the contents of /homedisk under /home. feel free to make
changes to /home. all the changes will be persisted in /homebuf.
</p>

<p>
now comes the interesthing part: how to commit changes from /homebuf to
/homedisk? first, as a matter of good hygiene, remount /homebuf as read only
(and for some reason this remount propagates to /homebufrw too so mount that
back as rw which then doesn&apos;t propagate back):
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o remount,ro /homebuf
  mount -o remount,rw /homebufrw
</pre>

<p>
you can only do this if there are no open writers. you list the writers like
this:
</p>

<pre>
  fuser -vMm /home 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep F
</pre>

<p>
if you are very careful, you could do the merge even if you keep /homebuf open
for writing as long as you avoid deleting the files it has open for writing. i
won&apos;t support this case though in my usync utility.
</p>

<p>
next, remount /homedisk or / as read-write:
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o remount,rw /homedisk
</pre>

<p>
now all you need to do is to move the contents from /homebufrw to /homedisk. i
wrote a small script for this called usync (see /usync.sh). run that.
</p>

<pre>
  usync /homebufrw /homedisk
</pre>

<p>
after that&apos;s done, you can simply restore the mounts and continue editing /home:
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o remount,ro /homedisk
  mount -o remount,rw /homebuf
</pre>

<p>
and that&apos;s all to it.
</p>

<p>
to make things even more convenient for myself, i made the following &quot;bsync&quot;
script for myself:
</p>

<pre>
  #!/bin/bash
  set -ex
  wmount disk
  usync /homebufrw /homedisk
  wmount buf
</pre>

<p>
wmount (see /wmount.c) a setuid script that lets me switch between rw mounting
either the disk or the buffer but not both. the point is that my disk is mounted
rw only during running the bsync command. and i also see what files changed
since the last sync.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s one annoyance with the current set of scripts though: they don&apos;t handle
fuse&apos;s interpretation of deleted but still open files well. fuse handles such
deletion via a simple rename. it renames a deleted file into &quot;.fuse_hiddenXXX&quot;
file. this shouldn&apos;t be sync&apos;d to backing store and it also means that after a
sync, i cannot delete everything from /homebufrw. however this is not super
common scenario so my usync tries to detect this and bails out if it&apos;s the case.
it also prints out which processes are keeping such files open. in such cases
it&apos;s up to the user to make the tasks release their open file descriptors.
</p>

<p>
in any case, i&apos;m using this setup for a few days now and it seems to be working
well. it&apos;s a bit annoying way to use a computer but it definitely works.
</p>

<p>
edit: oops, looks like unionfs-fuse still has some rough edges. i found a bug in
it: https://github.com/rpodgorny/unionfs-fuse/issues/91.
</p>

<h2 id="liquid">liquid</h2>
<p>
i always had problems with politics and voting. my problem with today&apos;s form is
that the system is way too simplistic and rigid. in the end the choice usually
boils down to choosing between two parties, the one you hate less. then wait and
hope things do not go way too bad. this is a false choice to me. i feel
completely disconnected from the process and therefore i feel like abstaining
until i see a better alternative.
</p>

<p>
i came across the liquid democracy idea which is pretty neat. i will not go too
deep into the details or merits of the idea but the main idea is that people can
vote on directly on the issues or appoint delegates that can vote on their
behalf in issues related to specific topics. people can change these delegations
at any moment. this makes campaign circus every 4 years somewhat obsolete which
is also a nice benefit.
</p>

<p>
it is also important to note that it is actually quite easy to migrate to a
democracy like this if people wish so. one can create party that provides the
above system and then commits to vote in the office according to the people&apos;s
wishes. if a person wants to vote for party x, they could still vote for this
proxy party and in the system they would set their preferences to follow party
x&apos;s votes. i understand politics is more than just voting but for the sake of
brevity i only want to focus on this part for now.
</p>

<p>
there is only one problem with this idea: it is not obvious how to maintain
anonymity in this system. i did a quick internet search but did not find much
discussion around the topic. i did find a lot of blockchain mumbo jumbo as if it
would solve anything in this aspect of the problem. or the other things i found
was questioning this feature of democracy which is also quite absurd. i am sure
there are lot of good solutions to this but before searching deeper, i like to
give it a thought of my own: how would i reinvent things with zero practical
knowledge. writing down just helps me make the ideas more concrete. i will get
everything wrong but at i might learn something out of this when i am reading
about serious solutions.
</p>

<p>
my system would have couple important concepts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  public profile: this is a person whose identity is publicly known and their
  votes are publicly visible for accountability. these people would be the
  &quot;politicians&quot; who would be publicly standing up for various things. anybody
  could register as a public person. voters can delegate votes only to public
  people.
</li><li>
  private profile: this is a user in the system without an identity attached.
  they can vote directly or delegate votes to public profiles. this is what most
  people would register as.
</li><li>
  issues: this is what people can vote on. you have a question and a list of
  outcomes that people can vote on. there would always be an option for
  abstaining, and also for marking the question as invalid or false choice. i am
  not sure about the voting algorithm though: i am vacillating between approval
  voting and instant runoff voting with optional preferences. i like the former
  for its simplicity. on the other hand the latter has even better properties at
  the cost of much harder decisionmaking at the voting time.
</li><li>
  tree of topics: each issue must belong to a specific topic. and each topic
  must belong to a parent topic (there would be a root topic). this is only
  needed for categorizing the questions for the convenience of delegations.
  think of topics as directories, issues as files in those directories if that
  makes it any simpler.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
had i a website for this, i would not allow much discussion to happen on the
site other than casting the votes. this way there is no need for moderation
which can avoid a lot of problems and makes the site lightweight. as to where
the votable issues coming from: that is a bit outside scope of this brainfart
but the general gist is that it would go through formal channels and the only
people that can suggest votable issues are the people who then agree to be held
accountable for the outcomes.
</p>

<p>
one familiar with the concepts of liquid democracy can probably already imagine
how one could create a system using the above concepts: after people log in,
they can see issues, cast their votes directly, or set up delegations to public
profiles for specific topics (e.g. healthcare, education, or just
education/highschoolers). they also see their historical votes, and what
delegation chain led to that vote if any.
</p>

<p>
however two issues remain: how to ensure one person can have only one account
and how can someone verify that their vote counted.
</p>

<p>
i assume that the country already has a way to uniquely identify its citizens
with some sort of official id card. i imagine this algorithm after i decided
that i want to participate in the voting anonymously:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i go to an official registration office where i show my id card and i receive
  a ticket in exchange.
</li><li>
  with the ticket i can register into the online system from home and
  participate in the votes for a limited time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
my main goal here is to ensure the fact that there is no computer system that
somehow associates my identity to my profile in the voting site. in order to
achieve this my idea is to split the registration into two steps done at a
different time by different organizations.
</p>

<p>
for simplicity let&apos;s assume the registration part happens in january (no voting
during that time) and voting happens during the rest of the year, from february
until december.
</p>

<p>
in january the first organization checks my identity and then it records this
fact into their database. this registration fails if i am already in the
database. the only thing the database records is the unique identifier on my id
card (e.g. social security number). then as a proof they (or some other trusted
organization) issue me a ticket which is a pair of public and private keys which
i can use as a proof that i correctly proved my identity. the ticket&apos;s public
key goes into a separate database so that the ticket is not linked to my id
number. the organization throws ticket&apos;s private key away, only the voter keeps
it.
</p>

<p>
on the 1st of february this organization would release the list of people who
registered for voting and the list of public keys of the tickets the system
generated. the two lists are not connected but they should have the same number
of elements. this way people could check who registered for voting and also
ensure that there are no invalid tickets maliciously generated (or if there are,
it&apos;s obvious). though the only way to audit the lack of invalid registrations
would be to confirm with every registered voter that they indeed registered.
independent auditors can probably use some statistical methods to estimate the
number of invalid registrations.
</p>

<p>
the second organization is the one that runs the voting site. in order to
register here you need a valid ticket from the first organization. you need the
private key for the registration and one ticket gives one registration only.
this way no person can register as another person unless they stole their
private key but in that case the former person cannot register. again, this
error is detectable even if not correctible. this system also does not collect
anything other than a (perhaps randomly generated) username and password. no
email address even to avoid the possibility of linking data after a leak (again:
users should use separate sites to keep informed about what is going on; i am
imagining an infrastructure service, not a social networking site). even the
ticket&apos;s public key is not linked to a specific user other than marked as used
in a separate table.
</p>

<p>
the registration is valid only for a year. people will lose passwords or have
their accounts hacked. since the system itself does not link accounts to the
real people, those accounts will be lost until their expiration. this would be
the cost of people not being careful with their password (a sort of perverse
democratic darwin award). however the damage is only temporary because next year
people can re-register.
</p>

<p>
the other problem is accountability of the votes. i think the solution for that
is just public dumps of the actual votes. after each vote the system releases a
big file that contains a row with 2 elements: random unique number identifying
the voter and the actual votes (the delegation chain would not be public, the
system resolves those automatically, only the final votes remain). the unique id
for the voters would change after each vote so that it is impossible for anyone
to track voters over time yet each voter can independently verify that their
vote is in the official dump.
</p>

<p>
and that would be the gist of it. obviously as it stands there are a lot of
rough edges that need careful thought. it does not rely on any wasteful
blockchain crap though. sure, it requires a trusted central authority running
this but as long as that authority is transparent, i do not see a problem with
this. if a society cannot arrange this, then no amount of blockchain technology
can save it. if it can then the blockchain tech is not really needed.
</p>

<p>
i can see a bunch of parties starting up. the only sad part of it that although
most of them embrace blockchain as the savior of earth, they do not care much
about anonymity. or at least they are not doing good job explaining why they ask
for my name and other data and how can i be sure that it will never leak away:
linking my votes and my identity. not that i particularly care about my votes
being public or not, i just want to make sure the system gets this aspect right.
i will look out for stuff like and see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
by the way, speaking of blockchain. one of my annoyances with blockchains is
that they unnecessarily burn lot of computation away. it&apos;s wasteful. i&apos;m using a
fully central solution here. i think that&apos;s a fair tradeoff in exchange for
greater efficiency. the whole system i&apos;m describing here could run on a single
raspberry pi even for multi-million users. usually centralization happens for
saving resources. i don&apos;t have much qualms about this as long as centralized
component&apos;s scope and features are very limited.
</p>

<p>
and the actual decisionmaking might slow down, one won&apos;t be able to make
unpopular things into law since people won&apos;t vote on it. i think that&apos;s fair
compromise. if someone wants to make an unpopular change affecting the whole
population, i think it&apos;s fair that they should first convince the whole
population to want it rather than forcing it down their throat (as opposed only
a few politicians). or maybe try to convince smaller communities to willingly
canary some changes and if only try for the global change if the canary was
successful. in any case, it might not be perfect, but i think it would make
people more interested in the whole political process.
