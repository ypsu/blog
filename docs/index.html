<p style=font-weight:bold>short intro about this site.</p>
<p>
welcome to notech.ie! i noticed that these days i am surrounded with fancy
technology. however over time i thought a lot and realized that that all this
unnecessary technology and general complexity around is making me unhappy. i
became a luddite to keep my sanity. sysadmin at day, technophobic at night. it
is not that i think technology is bad for humanity, i just have a bad personal
relationship with it. i need to vent about this someplace so i bought this
corner of the internet for myself to do so. among other things i loathe html,
css, capital letters so the content on this site is served as plainly as
possible in all lowercase. this way i can avoid dealing with all that baloney
just to jot some thoughts down. if for some reason you want to talk to me, write
an email to flubber at notech.ie.
</p>

<p>
fun fact: this site is available through the gopher protocol as well. if you do
not want to use the browser to read this, just use netcat on a linux:
</p>

<pre>
 nc notech.ie 70 &lt;&lt;&lt; /about
</pre>

<p>
github.com/ypsu/notech hosts the backup and history of this blog.
</p>

<p>
edit from 2021:
over the years i managed to curb my addictions
and deal with complexity a bit better.
i think writing out my frustrations helped.
generally i still agree with most of the stuff i wrote before
but now i made the frontpage into a html page.
that is a clear indication that i&apos;m softening.
who knows, maybe in 10 years i&apos;ll decide
to serve my posts in html rather than manually wrapped plaintext files
or start using uppercase letters even.
</p>

<h2 id="htmlized">htmlized</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>you can read this site in html.</p>
<p>
the problem with plain text is that it does not really have a standard on how to
rewrap it to other column sizes. i do not mind this, i just assume 80 columns as
the universal width. however that does not play nice with kindle. it wraps
plaintext quite awfully. there is not much it can do with plaintext. it can do a
much better job with html. i quite dislike html but it is a widely used and
supported format so it will do for this purpose. i have the full contents of
this blog available in html at html.notech.ie. i host this on a separate server
(github) because my little server only works for small, &lt;100k byte long files.
this limitation prevents me from creating overly long documents.
</p>

<p>
html.notech.ie contains the whole blog on one large site with minimal formatting
so it is very easy to either open on kindle&apos;s browser or just download and
convert it to a .mobi file. i wish more blogs and sites would allow easy binge
reading.
</p>

<p>
i also publish the last 4 articles to notech.ie/latest so followers can still
catch up in html without downloading everything on every visit. since this
always fits my arbitrary &lt;100k byte length limit, i am happy to host it myself.
</p>

<p>
note that i do not limit document width in the generated html because i think
that is rude. making the text narrower is always easier. i can make the browser
window narrower, use firefox&apos;s responsive design mode or its reading view, or
just open the javascript console and enter &quot;document.body.style.width =
&apos;30em&apos;;&quot;. making a document wider needs a phd in css.
</p>

<p>
update from 2020:
i read a tutorial about css which is almost the same as a phd.
on desktop the bottom right corner now has a small, draggable widget.
you can use that to make the text narrower or wider to your preference.
</p>

<p>
update from 2021:
i gave up on the draggable widget, it didn&apos;t really work well in some cases.
i now just set body&apos;s max-width to 50em and call it a day.
hopefully that&apos;s reasonable and not too narrow.
yes, i&apos;m rude now. :(
</p>

<h2 id="simulation">simulation</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>my answer to the meaning life.</p>
<p>
when i was a little kid, i always wondered where the christmas gifts come from.
people told me that jesus puts all the presents under the christmas tree. since
the gifts were there and i was not a particularly bright person (still not), i
accepted this explanation. they also told me that a god created the world and
that i will live forever in the heaven or hell after i die. but then i noticed
that one of toys i got was not new. so i pestered my parents about it and they
admitted that the gifts do not come from jesus but from them. so then i
questioned people about the rest of the story and most of them admitted that it
is just a story, it is not something that i can verify with my own eyes. i have
to &quot;believe&quot;. ummm. right. i think i will look around first, thanks.
</p>

<p>
so then i read about the people who claim that there is absolutely nothing after
death. there are no supernatural beings, there are no souls. we are just simple
biological meatbags that completely vanish after their expiration. there is not
much point to life other than just to &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;enjoy&quot; it while it
lasts. i will not get another change. there is nothing happening after death,
just like nothing happened before birth.
</p>

<p>
i found this quite an agreeable position. it is quite practical, its explanation
does not seem to require concepts that we cannot experience. however since i
went through one big disillusion before, i was trying to be more open minded
just in case i see even more convincing newer theories. however as i was reading
discussions around the topic, this biological-only camp seemed just as convinced
about their truth as their religious counterparts. i understand that believing
in mystical entities is not practical but flat out stating that things cannot
possibly exist seemed presumptuous. so i kept a &quot;i do not know&quot; stance instead.
</p>

<p>
later i came across the simulation argument. it says that assuming a
civilization can reach the technological point where it can run complex
simulations, it is possible that it has already happened. if one civilization
can reach it then probably many others can too. if that is the case then there
are many simulations running in the world. in fact it is quite likely that most
living organisms are in a simulation, including us.
</p>

<p>
i quite liked this train of thought. it does not try to explain what the world
is, it just a shows one possibility. it just says there we cannot be sure but
there is a chance that this is happening. at this point this did not look any
more practical than the complete denial of supernaturalism but the idea was
nevertheless interesting.
</p>

<p>
so i began thinking about simulations in general. how would i implement them?
how would i play in them? thinking like this opened my eyes. this simulation
assumption actually gives me practical ways on how to approach the &quot;what is the
meaning of life&quot;, &quot;what is the point&quot;, &quot;how should i live my life&quot; sort of
questions. all i need to do is just to apply my thoughts about the
implementation and simulation playing to this simulation (my life). so true or
not, it is practical for me.
</p>

<p>
one could argue that religion is also practical and beneficial. in fact it is
quite likely if we consider it from evolutionary standpoint. there are many
religions in the world. the ones that are overly harmful probably died out and
the ones that survived probably contain many beneficial practices. the problem
is that to pick up a religion&apos;s practices, one also has to pick up its way of
thinking which is usually &quot;stop thinking&quot;. but i quite like some of the ideas
religion has like
</p>

<ul><li>
  meetings: regular ritualistic meetings with the same folks helps people avoid
  isolation and folks can keep up with or watch over their community,
</li><li>
  rituals: sometimes waking up seems pointless but rituals or habits motivate
  people to not stop living,
</li><li>
  festives: rather than keeping every day gray these bring some variety into
  people&apos;s lives,
</li><li>
  legends: these build up some folklore, a shared history, something to talk
  about,
</li><li>
  afterlife: just something to motivate folks to be good to each other,
</li><li>
  fasting: i see more and more articles that this is actually quite beneficial,
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and probably more. however i think all this is achievable without the need to
stop thinking and blindly believing in mystical stories.
</p>

<p>
my foray into the simulation hypothesis will not rise to as mature way of life
as a religion but at least it is based on logic that i agree with. and
eventually little by little i can build up a similarly practical life based on
the observations from this hypothesis. so let me talk aobut what implications i
found from this.
</p>

<p>
the first way i think about the simulation hypothesis is how would i implement
it. there are two main ways to do it: i can make it static or i can make it
interactive.
</p>

<p>
by static simulation i mean something like a movie. the story is given, i can
replay it many times, the same thing happens every time. perhaps i can replay
the same events from a different person&apos;s perspective. i write a story i like
then i can &quot;join and live through&quot; the characters. this assumption leads to
observations like &quot;there is no free will&quot;, &quot;everybody has an importance&quot; or
&quot;there will be a grand ending&quot;.
</p>

<p>
by interactive simulation i mean something like a video game. there is no real
story given. all i have is this big sandbox where everybody is to themselves.
this leads to observations like &quot;there is not much meaning to all of this&quot; or
&quot;just have fun while it lasts&quot;.
</p>

<p>
my personal take on this is that we live in an interactive simulation. i take
this view solely from practical point of view. if the simulation is like a movie
then it does not matter what i do so i might become unmotivated. however if it
is interactive then what i do matters in the long haul.
</p>

<p>
then i also have to think about how complex the simulation can be. if i had to
implement it, i would probably go with the simplest implementation. this means
earth is the only planet in the entire universe with life on it. i would also
make arbitrary constants that make my implementation simpler like limiting the
maximum speed matter or effects can travel so that the supercomputers simulating
all this have an easier time chomping through all the data.
</p>

<p>
the other way to think about all this is to think about why and how would i
participate in the simulation. similarly i can ask why would i want to watch a
movie or why would i want to play a video game. there are usually two primary
reasons to do either of those. i play because i am bored. it is entirely
possible that the outside world is so boring that i am looking for more
fulfillment in the simulation. if i look at it this way, then i am in this for
the fun. just make sure the fun lasts long. alternatively i might be playing the
game or watching the movie because i want to feel challenged and want to feel
that i overcame the challenges. the world is full of challenges. it is up to me
take a chunk of it and complete them.
</p>

<p>
my take is on that i play this because i am bored in the outside world. compare
single and multiplayer games. in single player games there is a challenge i have
to overcome. however if i do not follow the game&apos;s campaign, the game does not
progress. also note that the characters in the game have usually different
roles, each helping me towards the goal or being the challenge i have to
overcome. the single player games usually have a beginning and end. once i
overcome the challenge, the game loses its appeal. on the other hand in
multiplayer games i usually play with other players. most challenges in
multiplayer games would be meaningless without the other players. i play the
game with others, me playing the game makes the game in some sense. most players
have the same roles and the game does not lose its appeal over time as long as
the player base is good. i play this game because it is fun, which means not
playing the game is a more boring activity.
</p>

<p>
the world i observe feels more like the multiplayer game where each player plays
for themselves rather than the single player game where each other entity is
there only for me. this is why i think that i am here out of boredom.
</p>

<p>
my biggest epiphany came when i considered to look at how i watch movies or play
video games. would it be a fun movie if the movie consisted of just other people
watching movies? or would it be fun if the video game consisted of playing other
video games? let me phrase it this way. suppose i want to play a shooter game.
in the shooter game i find an arcade machine on which i can play, say, pacman.
would i play pacman on it? for a few minutes, sure. but would i invest a lot of
time into playing pacman? if i like pacman so much, why not play a game that is
pacman and therefore is probably better designed? why would i invest a large
chunk of resources into a complex simulation in which i play a simpler
simulation?
</p>

<p>
this led me to my first practical observation: watching movies or playing
videogames is silly! to play now and then is fine but i must avoid sinking hours
daily into these activities.
</p>

<p>
and then many other observations started pouring in.
</p>

<p>
if this is a multiplayer game for fun, i should not ruin the game for others. in
fact, it is best if i can improve it for others. i should make the world a
better place to live in. ugh, tough order. but not ruining the game is a good
start.
</p>

<p>
if i am playing a multiplayer game then it is the other players that make the
game fun. it means that i am meant to live among others. i am meant to interact
with others.
</p>

<p>
if i am in this complex simulation with all these rich sensors in my body, i am
probably meant to use them. for instance in person interaction and communication
always feels richer thanks to all these sensors than the low bandwidth messaging
or videochat solutions. messaging is very good for coordination but i should not
use it to maintain long distance relationships. i should build new ones so that
i can the use the rich communication channel again.
</p>

<p>
players come and go. i should not stress too much about particular players. if a
player goes away forever, i shall seek other players to have fun with.
</p>

<p>
i should not stress too much about the past or lost opportunities. i can
probably always respawn and play again if i did not feel fully satisfied.
</p>

<p>
there is no end goal other than being happy. once i reach the point where we can
sustain ourselves with little work indefinitely, i should free up any unneeded
resources we use (e.g. a job) and help others achieve a similar state. with this
hypothesis, it is the other people rather than one&apos;s material possessions that
makes one happy.
</p>

<p>
and i could probably go on. but the general gist is that based on that the
meaning of life for me is to be happy, achieve happiness through personal
relationships, and help others be happy. this is a generally well accepted
meaning to life. but the nice thing about this is that i do not need to blindly
accept this because people in authority told me so. i devised this conclusion
from concepts i am familiar with via reasoning that i agree with. it does not
really matter if simulation hypothesis is true or not, it is a mental tool for
me that helps me make sense of the world. if i cannot understand something in
the world, i can use this tool to ask myself how and why would i implement such
a thing. sometimes things make a little more sense when looked that way. so
therefore my current stance about world is &quot;we probably live in a simulation&quot;
just because it is a practical assumption.
</p>

<h2 id="uppercase">uppercase</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>i don't like uppercase letters.</p>
<p>
why are there two glyphs for each english letter? why are there bunch of random
rules to decide which glyph to use in various situations? i honestly have no
idea. i suspect this might have been their history:
</p>

<ul><li>
  people chisel into stone tablets. only long straight strokes are practical so
  people use uppercase. only uppercase letters exist at this point.
</li><li>
  people start writing with hands. cursive scripts are much easier on the hand
  so people start rounding the letters. eventually these become the lowercase
  letters.
</li><li>
  to make books look fancy, the first letter on each page is a huge ass old
  style uppercase letter.
</li><li>
  everyone wants to look fancy, everyone makes the first letter old style
  uppercase letter.
</li><li>
  now every sentence starts with an uppercase.
</li><li>
  now every name starts with an uppercase.
</li><li>
  world implodes due to this insanity (not happened yet but soon will).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this is nonsense. there is zero difference how you pronounce uppercase letters
versus lowercase letters therefore there should not be two separate cases. &quot;oh
but it helps me find the sentence&apos;s start&quot;. boohoo. you will get used to it.
that is why punctuation exists. if uppercase letters would not exist and
somebody would want to invent it, people would laugh them off. say i invent a
middle case with completely different glyphs for each letter and the rule is to
use middle case at the end of sentences or names. does that sound ridiculous?
well, uppercase sounds just as ridiculous to me. most non-western languages do
not have this idiocracy.
</p>

<p>
why keep lowercase instead of uppercase? because lowercase is much easier on
eyes. it has larger variety in height. you see a word like &quot;apple&quot; and you can
see two spikes down before the middle and one spike up after the middle. chances
are you can still better guess the word after applying extreme blur levels
compared to its uppercase version where all letters have the same size.
</p>

<p>
and just imagine how significantly easier writing would become. no more effort
wasted about thinking or discussing the capitalization of titles, names, lists
and so on. less effort typing the uppercase letters. less computer logic to
compare words. if you want to make the world a better place then stop using
uppercase letters. please spread the word to make this revolution reach a
critical mass.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  edit 2021-06: i&apos;ve posted this to r/changemyview to challenge this idea.
</p>

<p>
here&apos;s the thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/oaqzcz/cmv_writing_doesnt_inherently_need_uppercase
</p>

<p>
i have to add that by this time i was already a bit softened with regards to uppercase letters.
i started programming in go.
it gives uppercase letters a meaningful function: it means a symbol is exported.
since i like go in general, i got used to it and embraced this meaning.
</p>

<p>
however capitalization of sentence beginnings and names still didn&apos;t make sense to me.
that&apos;s what most people argued for as the reason for these letters
but i didn&apos;t really find them convincing.
while i acknowledge they provide some minor benefits in terms of speed and clarity,
i still find the effect not big enough to warrant them.
it&apos;s just much simpler for me to write like this in my hidden little corner of the internet.
</p>

<p>
but in general i see some value in having separate letter case
when it&apos;s used for emphasis just like how you would use bold and italics.
but that&apos;s pretty much it.
</p>

<p>
if i wanted to dig deeper into the arguments,
i&apos;d need to split the issue into three key points:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the existence of uppercase letters (i sort of accepted this at this point),
</li><li>
  capitalization of sentence beginnings,
</li><li>
  capitalization of names.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the function of the last two is different.
arguing about all of them in a single thread is just too exhausting.
</p>

<p>
the most reasonable answers told me that it&apos;s fine in informal writing.
for formal writing it&apos;s just as it is but that&apos;s not necessarily set in stone.
if all lowercase gets common enough, maybe that could get formalized.
this means i should totally continue doing this
if i want to get all lowercaps more accepted in formal writing.
</p>

<h2 id="autocompletion">autocompletion</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>i prefer using my brain to autocompletion.</p>
<p>
there are two sorts of autocompletion. the first is where the autocompletion
just lists all possible syntaxically correct options, like path completion for
the cd command in bash. the other autocompletion is where a black box tells me
the most likely ending for whatever i am typing. over time i learned to loathe
both.
</p>

<p>
syntax completion is usually quite straightforward, predictable and generally
understood how it works. however it is often flaky and invoking the completion
then choosing the right option takes more time than what it would have taken if
i just typed in the option myself completely. it also allows complexity to stay,
it does not intrinsically motivate me to fix my environment such that
autocompletion is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
let me explain through the path completion example. suppose i have a bash open,
i am in a network file system directory with many files in it. i press tab tab.
now bash has to stat every file and the whole shell just locks up. when the
autocompletion is not instant, it is super annoying. do i just wait longer or
shall i try to kill the botched autocomplete or shall i type further and hope
for the best? all i wanted to spare typing 2 keyspresses and now i am involved
in a complex decision making process. the other issue is when i press
autocomplete too early, i get many choices and now i find myself reading through
all the choices and have to make a choice whether to continue typing or take the
first suggestion. again, in most cases i already know what i want and i could
have finished typing but now instead of doing that i am reading words on the
screen, eating up precious cache space in my small memory. the third problem is
that if i have deeply nested directory hierarchies, i just keep tabbing through
them. i never actually take action to fix them. &quot;it is not so bad&quot; i keep
telling myself.
</p>

<p>
so without syntax or path autocompletion, my editor will never lock up. i will
never need to think about whether to wait for autocompletion or not. no more
pondering whether i should debug or improve the autocompletion or not. no more
contemplation about the ideal autocompletion system. i just type the identifiers
naturally. the screen is not jumping around with random unrelated information
while i type. the only thing appearing is what i typed in, leading to a very
distraction free experience. this is a blessing since have a very easily
distractible personality. the other nice thing is that if i am forced to type in
long identifiers or deep path hierarchies regularly, i will have some motivation
to refactor the environment or structure so that such typing is unnecessary.
basically no autocompletion intrinsically helps me maintain simplicity in my
projects.
</p>

<p>
so these days i do not use any sort autocompletion. i even disabled path
completion in bash. it was very odd at first. but eventually i got used to and i
no longer miss autocompletion. and whenever people are complaining about an
autocompletion failure, i just smirk under my nose, and feel happy that i no
longer have such problems.
</p>

<p>
the other type of autocompletion is this machine learning based &quot;let me finish
what you started&quot; sort of machinery. basically it wants to finish my sentences
instead of letting me do so. i find this very misguided. i take pride that i am
able to formulate full sentences without external help. i do not want help in
writing. i do not use smartphones or other toys so i always have the ability to
comfortably type in any word or sentence i wish. if i do not type the words
myself, i do not learn how to spell them correctly. i am a kinesthetic learner.
if i do not practice something, i do not learn. similarly if the computer
finishes my thoughts, it is much harder for me to think. if i do not need to
think then why am i even here? thinking and formulating full sentences is fun
for me, i do not want computers to take that away. the implementation is usually
also quite distracting. say i start typing a list of keywords i am interested in
and then the search box starts suggesting others. the problem with this is that
sometimes the suggested keyword has absolutely zero relevance to my query, yet i
find it interesting so i am likely to search for that instead of what i
originally wanted. basically the search box is taking away control of my
interests and telling me what to look for instead. i am weak against temptations
so i find it manipulative if things take advantage of this. so i do not want
this either. i made sure that i see no completion on my machine when i use it. i
can think and type for myself, thank you very much.
</p>

<h2 id="history">history</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>i don't keep shell and browser history.</p>
<p>
tracking every minute detail of my daily failings is pointless. i am talking
about collecting the history of every command i execute in bash, every url i
visit in a browser, or every gps coordinate i ever visited. this is a lot of
data. most of it is just noise. whenever i wanted to look up some data in
history, it actually took very long time browsing through all the data and
sometimes i did not find what i was seeking. i found it is actually more
efficient to reconstruct the command or url from scratch. it also helps me
exercise my memory so it dwindles away slower. i often relied on bash history to
find the right parameterization for a command i remembered using. without
history i cannot do this. but i am better off this way. i am no longer relying
on an external, private, somewhat volatile database to interact with the
computers. it forces me to familiarize with the documentation. if that is
lacking, it motivates me to improve said documentation. better documentation
makes the environment nicer for others too. since i have to type out the
arguments myself, i get more acquainted with the commands themselves from which
i often pick up clever, out of the box ideas. in the urls&apos; case it forces to
learn the url structure of the websites, and to come up with succinct urls for
my own work. sharing urls is very easy and natural when urls are sane.
</p>

<p>
maintaining this history database is also quite the pain. i am not comfortable
keeping my bash, browsing or gps history in some non-personal device or an
external device not encrypted by me. when i use multiple computers, shells,
browsers then maintaining this history becomes quite complicated. i value my
sanity so i would need elaborate bash hacks to keep the history in sync across
computers. perhaps i would consider even more elaborate hacks if i wanted to
inject new history into an already running bash process. or when i use multiple
browsers then they have separate histories and i usually do not remember what
history is in which browser. i could probably set up some sort of elaborate
syncing scheme between them too if i would care enough.
</p>

<p>
the history database might not contain everything. it will not contain entries
from my incognito browsing. i might be remembering that i visited a website,
then i would try to look it up in the history but i will not find there. i would
spend a lot of time before i would realize i used incognito so the history will
not have it. the bash process can also suddenly die and lose precious history in
it which i would then feel bad about.
</p>

<p>
the history does not have good availability guarantees. i might accidentally
truncate all my bash history. i would then feel very sad. or i might decide that
i want to use a different computer and now the history is gone and i have hard
time using it. or if i store my history on a network service, my workflow
depends on that network being available. it is just another unnecessary
dependency.
</p>

<p>
keeping all the history slows down the application. bash now needs to read in
all history before it shows its prompt. not only i have a slower startup, but
now i also have less memory available for other work too. bash and the browsers
need to keep some history in the memory too to keep lookups fast. and in bash&apos;s
case it probably does not even share history between the processes so i would be
paying this cost multiple times.
</p>

<p>
the history might have chance of leaking. suppose somebody sits down to my
computer and starts browsing. now they could easily see all my naughty sites i
visit or the naughty data i have. if it is on a networked service, then there is
a chance that there will be a global leak at some point and then everybody will
have access to everybody else&apos;s history. that might contain some things i would
not be comfortable with others seeing.
</p>

<p>
and do not even get me started on the idea of tracking gps location history.
that is wrong on so many levels that i will not even bother trying to explain
it. i do not use gps nor smartphones so i do not have this problem. but i
suspect smartphones have this feature enabled by default. it is just something
to be aware of. i understand that my carrier probably tracks my brick phone&apos;s
whereabouts but at least i do not have to worry that 7 independent services also
tracking it via their preinstalled spyware.
</p>

<p>
so i stopped caring about my tracking my history. i find that this leads to much
healthier practices, better memory, less work and less worrying about losing or
leaking said history. therefore i disabled history where i could: bash and the
browsers. note that i still keep per session history in bash because otherwise
correcting typos in commands would be super annoying. but i never write out the
history to disk. i actually use a raspberry pi as my primary hobby computer so i
get less wear on my sd disks this way which is a nice plus. besides, forgetting
is a feature. if i forget something, then 99% of the cases it is a good
riddance. no need to carry on the past forever.
</p>

<h2 id="simplicity">simplicity</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>you need strict limits to maintain simplicity.</p>
<p>
i really dislike maintaining and debugging complex systems. i suspect nobody
likes them. yet no matter how hard people try, we always end up in a mess.
however i do not think this has to be the case. we should be able to create
simple systems. all we need is a set of healthy practices and an agreement from
all parties participating in the system that we want to avoid ending up in a
complex system. everything starts simple but it is actually quite hard to keep a
system simple especially if said system grows in number of features, components
or participants. but here is one of the key observations: growth is what starts
making systems complex. usually growth results in weird new interactions between
the system&apos;s components. the system&apos;s original design might not be a good fit
for the new, larger usecase.
</p>

<p>
so here is the key lesson from that observation. if everything starts out simple
but then growth makes systems complex then all we need to do is stop the growth.
easier said than done. this is especially hard if the sole goal of our system is
to replace other more complex systems. but if we allow growth, our system will
grow into the same complex system we were trying to replace. my take from this
is that we ought not to replace existing systems with new systems entirely. in
fact the new system should explicitly forbid to grow into the same proportions
as the larger system.
</p>

<p>
one way to achieve growth limitation is to set explicit limits for the features
in the system. when a limit is reached then do not just bump the limit but
either move the misfit component out of the system or restructure said component
so that it works in the system. growth in such a system is going to be super
frustrating. but it is that growth that the system is set up to prevent. people
usually do not like systems that make them frustrated so such system cannot
become a popular system. that is the downside. on the other hand the
participants who accept the limits willingly will stay happy because they will
not get bogged down with all the unnecessary complexity.
</p>

<p>
allow me to demonstrate these concepts with an example. my ideal computing
environment is where every component of the stack from the operating system to
all the user space applications is super simple, easily understandable,
reviewable, perhaps tweakable. this environment might not as efficient as a hand
optimized mainstream stack but i would not mind that because i can then
understand my tools with less expertise. it would be easier to customize the
system to my usecase.
</p>

<p>
one component of this stack would be the text editor. i could decide on its
implementation. i could use fancy linked lists to manipulate large chunks of
text efficiently. or i could impose terrible limits on my text. i could say this
editor will not support lines longer than 100 columns and 10_000 lines. such
draconian limits would significantly simplify the implementation because i will
no longer need to think about efficient ways to handle large files or files with
long lines. using such editor will be quite terrible too. most people would hate
these arbitrary limitations. i would not mind though. i suspect there would be a
handful of other people who would also embrace this. first of all, people can
get used to limitations. early computers had tiny amounts of memory, yet most
things still worked out finely. secondly, if my system has an arbitrary limit of
100 columns per line, then writing other tools are much easier too. they do not
need to have complex logic to handle arbitrary length strings or concern about
algorithms that do not scale well to long strings. the simplicity of this
arbitrary constraint cascades through the whole system.
</p>

<p>
arbitrary limits or constraints are not only useful to keep the system simple.
they force me to become creative. suppose i am writing some complex software. i
keep writing the whole shebang into one file and after some time i reach the
10_000 line mark. on a contemporary system i do not even notice that this
happened. however in this limited system i suddenly become painfully aware that
i hit the system&apos;s limit. i am now forced to step back and perhaps split my
project into smaller modules at that stage. at that line count that is probably
a good idea anyways. so the constraints keep me on my toes and keep my activity
in check. these constraints are not just something to keep some parts of the
system&apos;s implementation easy but also to signal to the system&apos;s components what
are the expected behavior and resource usage they have to work with. keeping the
overall system simple is not something to graze over though. it is no
coincidence that even these days people still make commodore or amiga demos just
because working in a limited, fully learnable environment is so refreshing.
</p>

<p>
but note that if i am paid to write software for others, i am often not terribly
excited about the projects i am supposed to do. if i run into some frustration
stemming from arbitrary constraints of a tool, i might be tempted to simply
switch to a tool that does not have said limitation. the resource costs,
inefficiencies, the bugs of that tool or the complexity debt i add due to using
a more complex tool is not my problem, my employer can pay others to deal with
it. and this is actually nice because this way my employer can pay others to
make faster and larger computer chips or ready software bundled with many
features and thus the world does not stop progressing. though note that if i am
solely on the hook for said tool then i would start looking into refactoring my
use of the tool instead.
</p>

<p>
however in my hobby environment i really the idea of simplicity stemming from a
constrained environment. so when i am writing my little tools in c i do not shy
away from just using a few large arrays and returning an error if i try to use
them on a larger input. this way they do not become slower over time as the
input grows unboundedly. i know the input limits at the time of writing so every
decision i made in its code is based on that assumption. if the input outgrows
my tool, i usually need to rearchitect my tool anyways. i usually do not know in
which dimension will my tool grow. does my text editor need to handle longer
lines or more lines? making the tool scale in every dimension makes its code
super complicated. at first i will assume no scalability and then if the need
really arises, i might think a little bit about it.
</p>

<p>
it is not just my computing environment i like simplicity and predictability.
this is also why i do not own a smartphone. it is such a complicated device. but
everything can be done on a desktop computer too. with a desktop computer i am
physically constrained to be in front of the computer to use it. i actually like
this constraint otherwise i might just keep checking my smartphone all the time,
even when i would be better off just looking at the nature or listen to the
chatter of others. another example would be the fact that i very much dislike
spending money which has many ramifications. for instance i try to avoid
spending money on transportation and therefore i walk everywhere if i can. at
the time of writing this my commute to work takes 1 hour by walking. this
arbitrary constraint of being a cheapskate actually keeps me somewhat fit and
gives me 2 hours daily just to meditate and think things through. my life gets
simpler and i actually feel happier because of the workarounds i need to do due
to these voluntary limitations. and this is why i like voluntary constraints.
</p>

<h2 id="markup">markup</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>simple markup for simple posts.</p>
<p>
i hate most markup languages because of their feature creep. it all started with
html. it is the most popular markup language since most web is in that format. i
am not sure if it was ever meant for humans to write though. probably not.
however it is not so bad if you do so and only use the basic features. but most
sites i visit generate their html from other sources of truth so browsing the
internet without a html parser is impossible. this is quite sad though. i think
its original goal was to mark up plaintext document with &quot;links&quot; and that is why
it was called hypertext markup language. and while at it they added some extra
markup to separate individual paragraphs and to insert headings, emphasis,
simple lists, tables and images. then based on the capabilities and the settings
of the client&apos;s computer, a browser rendered the document as nice as it could.
</p>

<p>
but html today is not what it used to be. i do not consider it as a markup
language anymore. i consider it as a file format to render resizable &quot;content&quot;
in a browser. it is a programming language. as such i am no longer in control
how the computer renders the document for me. even worse, some sites go as
moronic as to use their own crappy font from the internet rather than the fonts
i specifically set. i have preference for specific fonts and i prefer to read in
those. or set a maximum width for their document. have these people not
considered that there exist people on this planet that are able to read more
than 2 words per line? making lines shorter is easy since i can just make the
browser window smaller or go into the browser&apos;s reader mode. making lines longer
is much trickier. oh, i could disable css. but then often the document becomes
tangled in the sense that all the content and non-content bits are interspersed
in one giant blob of text. website owners really should really consider ensuring
that their site still works without css and javascript. basically make sure the
site is browsable in the links terminal browser.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand crappy site usually also means crappy content. so if the site
tries to force a specific &quot;viewing experience&quot; then chances are it is trying to
compensate for low quality content that i would not really want to read if it
were to presented in, say, plaintext format. therefore i rather avoid such
websites. visiting fancy websites actually reminds me that i probably should be
doing something better instead. so thanks for doing that.
</p>

<p>
the other markup popular markup language is markdown. it started out simple and
with the explicit goal that the plaintext version of the document remains just
as readable. it added a little bit too many features in my opinion though. but
that would not have been too much of a problem had it stayed that way. but when
i look at the newest versions it is utterly nonsensical. for instance i open the
commonmark&apos;s specification and i am presented gazillions of features and then
long discussion about all the corner cases of those misdesigned features. and i
suspect it will get much worse over time. when a person starts using all those
fancy features it is again a smell that the author is spending way too much time
on the presentation which suggest that the underlying content might not be as
interesting as they wanted it to be.
</p>

<p>
really there should be only a handful of features needed. all the markup
language for simple documents is supposed to do is to make it resizeable so the
readers can read it on various devices with various font sizes. here is the list
of features that ought to be enough for everyone:
</p>

<ul><li>
  headings: this allows generating table of contents and allows creating anchors
  for specific sections. no more than 2 levels though excluding the document&apos;s
  title.
</li><li>
  lists: unordered only. lists are handy organization tool. usually people
  prefer the text to be indented so that it is easy to skip to the next entry in
  the list visually. this changes the resizing logic a little bit and this is
  why needs to be a first class element.
</li><li>
  preformatted content: this section would look exactly the same in the rendered
  document as it looks in the source with monospace fonts. very handy for tables
  or code blocks. usually this is only needed in technical documents. most text
  would be fine without this.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and this is all what is needed. stop at that and i am happy. those features are
quite straightforward to implement and do not have corner cases. in fact this
website is written in a markup language that only uses those features. look at
my /htmlize article to see how this site gets transformed into a nice html page
in a few lines of awk code. it does not support headings though because i just
use different files to organize different sections. the generator creates the
headings based on the filenames.
</p>

<p>
and here is what is not needed in a markup language for simple documents:
</p>

<ul><li>
  hard line breaks: just use lists or preformatted content.
</li><li>
  emphasis: just use punctuation marks like quotes to emphasize a word or
  sentence. as with all practices, once you get used to this, you will not miss
  the italics.
</li><li>
  bold, underline: these create a very jarring effect on the text. bolded words
  pulls my eyes towards themselves and that makes reading the surrounding text
  harder. please do not make your text harder to read.
</li><li>
  tables: there is no nice way to express this. just use the preformatted
  content for tables. if you have trouble editing tables in plaintext then
  either simplify your tables or use a text editor which can edit plaintext
  tables.
</li><li>
  ordered lists: just use unordered lists and begin each entry with the entry&apos;s
  number of other identifier used to signify the order. usually when you number
  something, you do so so that you can refer to entries by number later on. such
  references get out of date very quickly if you add a new step. therefore
  rather than using numbers for reference, you could use some sort of
  identifiers too. e.g. in the 12 step plan instead of writing &quot;- 5. admit to
  yourself ...&quot; you would write &quot;- confession: admit to yourself ...&quot;. then
  instead of referring to &quot;the 5. step&quot;, you refer to &quot;the confession step&quot;. the
  latter style needs more creativity but it turns out to be more memorable.
  note: in an earlier version of this document i did support ordered lists. then
  i realized i never used them and that unordered lists can be used to emulate
  them so i decided i do not need the complexity of the ordered lists either.
</li><li>
  paragraphs in lists: if your content in the list is so long that you need
  several paraphraphs then it is best that you do not organize the content into
  lists but into paragraphs.
</li><li>
  lists in lists: please avoid doing this. nested structures are quite hard to
  follow. just be creative and organize differently. use preformatted content if
  you really need a specific structure.
</li><li>
  links: i do not like the fact when the document tries to hide what it is
  pointing at. i much prefer to see the naked links. so just write out the link
  in its entirety. then the document renderer can decide to render these bits as
  links. the markup language does not need any special support for this. this
  also requires for the writer to simplify the link so that it remains short and
  sweet. short links help the reader understand where the link points to. but do
  not use url shortening services, that is cheating. in general, avoid writing
  in a way that requires links or even footnotes. it makes reading much harder
  because the reader is now tempted to check out the link rather than just
  simply continue reading. i am very easily distracted so reading a document
  with many links or footnotes ruins the experience. just have a &quot;further
  references&quot; section at the end of the document for the links with a short
  summary what each link is about.
</li><li>
  footnotes: footnotes are quite distracting because of the temptation of
  checking them out and then navigating back and forth in the document. but in
  some cases they are unavoidable, like in wikipedia&apos;s case where you want to
  reference the source of all claims. however these do not really need to part
  of the markup either. you can just use, say, bracketed identifiers like
  [myref] and then have a references section at the end of the document which
  expand these references. the document renderer does not need to add support
  for this either. if you are curious about a reference, you can just search for
  &quot;[myref]&quot; in the reference section and you can read it. in fact to do not make
  navigating references easier than that because otherwise writers are tempted
  to use them to add interesting footnotes rather than incorporating those bits
  into the main document. for footnotes i recommend using parenthetical comments
  instead.
</li><li>
  blockquotes: just use quotation marks. if you have a longer section that you
  want to indent, you can always a single element long list. it is a bit weird
  but just as effective and simplifies both the format and renderer because they
  do not have to support yet another feature.
</li><li>
  images: most documents do not need images. but sometimes an image indeed adds
  a lot of value to a document. in plaintext all you can do is to provide a link
  to the image. so you can use that. maybe i would accept a notation where you
  prepend the url with a &quot;!&quot; to signify that the renderer should inline the
  image. but never use this to embed videos or gifs. only add static images. i
  am incapable of reading text if there is any movement on my screen.
</li><li>
  scripts: if your document needs scripts then it is not really a plain document
  but rather a tool or an application. probably it is not meant for simple
  consumption but interaction. e.g. if you add some sharing or commenting widget
  then you are probably not trying to teach or entertain people but rather you
  are trying to garner some reaction and perhaps sell something. you are in some
  shady business then. people should probably avoid your document. if you are
  considering enabling comments then it is better to go to online forums and
  make your posts there instead. such places are better suited for discussions.
  or just have your readers send feedback privately. then you can do a summary
  post with the feedback and your response integrated into the text. the quality
  of your site remains higher and your readers have an easier way to keep up
  with you.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if somebody has something interesting to say, they do not need formatting. they
can just tell it plainly. if a text is trying to explain a complex concept,
fancy formatting will not make it easier. it will just give it an appearance of
simplicity but not actually help. i recommend improving the text instead so that
it explains the concept more vividly or with more examples.
</p>

<p>
as for my markup the rules are simple. the document is considered in paragraphs
where paragraphs are separated with empty lines. the paragraph&apos;s first line
determines what sort of paragraph it will be. if it begins with space, i wrap
the whole thing into a &lt;pre&gt;. if it begins with a &quot;- &quot;, i treat is as an
unordered list and each line starting with &quot;- &quot; starts another element. if none
of the above matches, i wrap the paragraph into an ordinary &lt;p&gt; tag. and that is
all there is. no corner cases, no complicated implementation needed. if i cannot
express something with the above rules then that just means i am not challenging
myself enough. i then go and think hard and come up with a way that can fit
those rules. the result is then much simpler and i am then usually more pleased
with it and thus i am happier. simple, constraining rules lead to better
documents.
</p>

<p>
example in case you are viewing this in the html version:
</p>

<pre>
 test paragraph
</pre>

<pre>
 - unordered list
   with multiple lines
 - and entries
</pre>

<pre>
 - 1. simulated ordered list
 - 2. entry two
</pre>

<pre>
  pre
     formatted
               content
</pre>

<pre>
  table example:
</pre>

<pre>
   id |   name | age |  weight
   ---+--------+-----+--------
   13 |  james |  37 |   88 kg
   27 | sophia |  42 |   70 kg
   39 |   john |  30 |  123 kg
</pre>

<p>
gets translated to this:
</p>

<p>
test paragraph
</p>

<ul><li>
  unordered list
  with multiple lines
</li><li>
  and entries
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  1. simulated ordered list
</li><li>
  2. entry two
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
 pre

<pre>
 table example:
</pre>

<pre>
  id |   name | age |  weight
  ---+--------+-----+--------
  13 |  james |  37 |   88 kg
  27 | sophia |  42 |   70 kg
  39 |   john |  30 |  123 kg
</pre>

<p>
and that demonstrated all the features i need and support. it is not necessary
the nicest but it is functional enough for me.
</p>

<h2 id="gps">gps</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>gps makes us lazy.</p>
<p>
the global positioning system is a marvel of human engineering, no doubt at
that. however i really wish it would not exist. my personal beef with the gps is
sucks the fun out of the exploration. i owned a smartphone for about a year
before i threw it away so i do have some experience with gps and navigation. in
those days whenever i wanted to go to any place, i just simply put in the
destination into the device and then followed the path it devised. rather than
looking up and learning about my environment, i was looking down to my phone,
following the arrow and only looked up occasionally to check which street i have
to turn onto. basically i felt that my phone reduced me to a mindless drone. i
was completely fine before the gps, never felt that i was missing it but after
the phone ditch event i felt some withdrawal effect from it. i was even a bit
afraid to venture outside just because i might get lost. however i feel much
happier without it. whenever i want to go to a place i have not been yet, i have
to plan ahead. i have to study the map. i have to learn about large landmarks
that can guide my path. i can perhaps walk through the path virtually through a
street view application. i even draw myself a minimap just in case i do not
remember all the details. then i can execute the journey. during the journey i
am very attentive to my environment. i am sort of in the csíkszentmihályi like
flow where my mind is quietly alert and focused on one thing. i am also very
confident because i know what i expect at every corner. and when i successfully
get to my journey i am quite happy that i planned well and managed to execute
that plan successfully. or maybe i feel happy because of the flow state i was in
for long time. so having no gps, makes my life more fun.
</p>

<p>
okay so i do not need gps but then why do i say it should not even exist? my
problem is that i do know that it is very easy to get hooked on it. once hooked
it is very hard to imagine life without it. people will forget that there are
others who do not have access to gps devices. they will not learn to give
directions in an effective way. they will not create landmarks that simplify
navigation. so my problem is that if society gets overly dependent on gps then
that society will be harder to navigate through without the gps because there
will be no intrinsic motivation to make it simple. basically it will make the
towns and other places less accessible.
</p>

<p>
it even ruins videogames. when i play an open world game, it usually has some
sort of waypoint system so i am just reduced to mindlessly following the
waypoint there too. i do not even look at all the nice scenes the game artists
created for me to enjoy. there is no exploration required. sure, i could turn
off the navigation system but then the game becomes unplayable because the
quests in the game do not fully explain the destination and often there is no
good way to look up a route to the destination and then following that route
without constantly checking the minimap if i am at the place i am supposed to be
or not. this is the effect i was talking about: if people assume that gps
exists, they will not make the place accessible for non-gps users.
</p>

<p>
what i would really wish instead that we would make navigating the world so
simple that a gps is just not needed. suppose a city is organized into a grid of
roads and all the roads are just numbered sequentially. such city would be
boring. but navigating would be super simple because you only need two numbers
to specify a location in it. you can get to that location from any given
location without a map. we should have more like that. so whenever you are
coming up with organization scheme for physical space, try to come up with a way
that does not require navigation tools. make it boring. boring structures make
me happy. please make me happy.
</p>

<p>
and the other problem with universal gps access is the privacy violations it
leads to. large organizations or family might want to know where each member is
at any given moment which usually does not lead to trusting relationships. it is
a silly idea at this point but as technology proliferates it might become more
and more accepted. i might only want to track track my children at first for
their own &quot;safety&quot;. when i fully make terms with that arrangement, i start
thinking of tracking a spouse for their &quot;safety&quot;. then when i get terms with
that arrangement, i might want start tracking more and more family members and
so they want track me in exchange. now everybody is tracking everybody&apos;s
movements. then when governments want to track me for my own own &quot;safety&quot;, i
might not be objecting to it because it is now &quot;normal&quot; to track people. the
situation is horrible at this point. the whole thing escalates in baby steps. it
is better to stop the whole thing in its roots and just live in a way that does
not require the knowledge of one&apos;s position on this planet.
</p>

<h2 id="cars">cars</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>my annoyances with cars in cities.</p>
<p>
i currently live in a high density area and i learned to despise cars. they are
noisy, inefficient and take up way too much space. there is no place for cars in
inner cities. in fact allowing cars makes a few things more inefficient:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the road and parking infrastructure takes up a lot of space, pushing
  everything even more distant from each other further excarberating the need
  for assisted transportation.
</li><li>
  having cars around slows down walking through the city because i now need to
  wait for the cars to pass whenever i cross streets.
</li><li>
  walking around is more stressing because of the extra noise and awareness
  needed due to the cars. it is much harder to meditate thorough my walk.
</li><li>
  people using cars do not use the public transportation system, so it has less
  chance improving. i often hear people use cars just because they do not like
  the public transportation. but that is just because they do not complain in a
  way that is visible to the public transportation. if they were forced to use
  the service, they would be intrinsically motivated to improve it one way or
  another.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i understand that cars are very practical tools but i believe over the long term
they lead to less efficient cities. and no matter how technologically advanced
we make cars, city dwellers simply should not require cars. but as long as we
allow cars in the cities, a lot of people will not be able to imagine existing
without them. there is a quick way to teach people living without cars though.
just ban all cars except the public transportation, ambulances and other
licensed infrastructure supporting vehicles. perhaps the transition should be
slower than an overnight ban but the endgoal should be the complete ban. maybe
start with a small inner circle for the ban and then slowly extend the ban with
more and more nearby streets every year until after a decade or two the whole
city is car free. this would be a shock for a lot of people. they will get used
to it though and find creative alternatives to whatever things they required
cars for. if a population is forced to evolve, it will evolve. if some people
still miss sitting in cars, they can always go live on the countryside. in
exchange city dwellers can enjoy the efficiencies and benefits of car-free
living.

<h2 id="money">money</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>it's bad to rely too much on money.</p>
<p>
money can be practical tool or a cause of big stress in life. it depends how
much you have. have less than what you need then you are causing problems to
yourself, having more than you need then you are making your future self
happier. it would be nicer if the stressing part could go away. does humanity
even need money? as a kid, i did not really need it. my family provided for
everything. even neighbors, relatives often brought gifts or cooked food without
expecting anything in return. i only needed money when i was interacting with
strangers. those strangers did not know me, did not trust me so they needed an
alternative way of giving their goods without feeling bad about themselves. so i
used money there. i guess i could say money is an alternative to trust. it is
not as powerful but still, a simple, one dimensional tool. however i much
preferred the world where things were not reduced to this one dimension. in fact
if i am doing a small favor to someone, i refuse to accept money. that would
just convert this rich sense of trust i acquired into numbers. i would rather
keep the trust than the money. often it is unclear how much money should actions
convert into. even if you assign a value, it changes over time. in the meantime
trust remains constant.
</p>

<p>
i often wonder if such moneyless living is still possible in adulthood. i could
imagine a community of people who live together and agree to share the costs of
living in exchange to not deal with the costs individually. for instance this
group of people might live in a large, multi bedroom shared house with a single,
shared bank account. each person makes a periodic fixed contribution to the bank
account. then the &quot;finance person&quot; pays the bills and rents from that said bank
account. the kitchen is also shared and somebody always fills it up from the
shared bank account. somebody might cook something nice for everybody every day.
maybe group would share bus passes, swimming pool passes or access rights to
other luxuries. the point is that the everyday life does not depend money. the
community members do not need to take their your purse or credit card for rents,
bills or food. that would be quite nice way of living. i am prone to obsess
about spending. i see almost all spending of mine as some sort of inefficiency
and then i start researching and thinking how can i optimize my behavior so that
my spending goes nearer to zero. however if i do not see the bills, i do fine,
blissfully ignorant. the missus already learned that she is better off if she
hides the bills away from me.
</p>

<p>
such shared living does not scale infinitely though. to maintain harmony all
members have to be in sync with each other. they have to have shared values,
house rules and matching personality. maybe it scales up to a dozen of people
tops although i think 4 adults is about the ideal number. finding the right
people is really important. i lived in a few environments and i learned that if
i leave my roommates or living mates up to chance, i will not like it. however
if i pick people i like, it actually enhances my quality of life compared to
living alone or just with a partner. i am really conscious how my words affect
other people so i usually withdraw from conversations just to be safe. i just
listen to others talk. however if i know every person well enough in my
immediate vicinity, i feel more free to talk. so living among friends gives more
opportunity for idle chit chat and other activities which can often be quite
entertaining and fun that i otherwise would not enjoy among strangers or other
acquaintances. the problem is i have not found a good way to easily find the
right people. but that and shared living is a different can of worms.
</p>

<p>
in such arrangements i do not need to think about buying my own food anymore. if
kitchen is always stocked, i can grab some food from there anytime. no more
obsessing about bills. i outsourced my worries to &quot;my tribe&quot;. even if i am
thinking about an expensive purchase of a luxury, like buying a used fixie bike
because i suddenly want to go on a bike tour, i can ask the help of my tribe.
they can verify if this is a sane reason for spending the money, and if so they
can help me with the purchase. they can help negotiate prices, do the financial
transactions and so on. i do not even have to personally think about money. i
trade with trust within my tribe members and on a higher level the tribes trade
with money between each other.
</p>

<p>
maybe a very limited form of the above thoughts could scale up to a larger
community as well. imagine a small but densely occupied town. this town could
have provide cheap free food for whoever that wants it (within limits, e.g. you
have eat everything right at serving). if it serves cheap porridge or just stale
bread every day, that is fine too. maybe it could even have a nearby facility
with clean water and warm rooms. maybe even allow sleeping there. think of
nothing fancy, just mattresses on the floor, rooms perhaps shared with others.
the barest minimum to satisfy the lowest level in the maslow&apos;s hierarchy of
needs. i think keeping up such a facility would not cost a lot of money. most of
the cost would go into the salaries of people running the facility. and probably
nobody would want to use such facilities willingly (i guess i would be an
exception). however having such facility available would mean that no matter
what you have or not have, simple living is available for everyone for free. i
think having free, no questions asked access to the facilities for the basic
needs should be the marker of advanced society. money, trading and access to
luxuries can come after that. i feel just simply giving a lot of money to people
is less effective way to a prosperous civilization. i am not against it, it is
just i think we should not base our pillars of society on money but rather on
infrastructure. once the latter is in place, money can flow freely. let me
demonstrate on a few examples why i think infrastructure would be a better
solution over the long term:
</p>

<ul><li>
  societal integration between the haves and havenots: with free money i think
  this would just decline. from what i can see, rent in cities keeps growing. if
  the poor people do not have access to subsidized housing, they will be forced
  out of the city. thus cities will only house the rich and elites of humanity.
  i think our society should be inclusive and come up with ways that diverse set
  of people can live together, regardless of their income. the people who want
  isolation are the ones who should move out of the cities.
</li><li>
  motivation: if i have to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress and eat the same
  crappy porridge every day, i would be probably intrinsically motivated to do
  something about it. even the slightest extra income can grant me access to a
  luxury. maybe i can get someone give or pay me a decent lunch if i cut their
  grass. maybe then i will be motivated to go back for that extra income. with
  free money, i can decide to save money by keeping my room&apos;s temperature lower
  and then afford a decent lunch every day but otherwise i can still just stay
  at home and do nothing useful, e.g. writing articles like these. the point is
  that the difference between no job and some job is much larger and thus more
  motivating.
</li><li>
  homelessness: in the free money situation people can still stay homeless if
  they for some reason do not have access to money. i might be visiting a
  different city and i might lose my wallet and phone. now i cannot get
  accomodation. in the free infrastructure scenario it is no big deal. i can
  actually decide to go without the wallet because i can food and a bed for free
  anyways.
</li><li>
  stability: the current monetary system does not look super stable to me.
  people will always argue how much money should i get. and even if i get some
  money, the next day it might become worthless because some rogue algorithm
  messed up the whole financial system. infrastructure sounds a more stable
  proposition. just because new york exploded, does not mean that the porridge
  reserves in my town evaporate into air. i can still rely on receiving food the
  next day.
</li><li>
  system understanding: in my opinion it is important for the members of a
  community to understand how their community works so that they easily help
  out. understanding infrastructure is much easier than understanding the
  financial system. the goal of the infrastructure is to satisfy the needs of
  its users. the problems that can arise are usually technical in nature. if
  there is no water then somebody can go and repair the pipes or get water via
  alternative means. if the rent is too high in a city, people cannot just go
  and make it lower.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and the ideal way to design such &quot;living infrastructure&quot; is to have the
designers actually live in the infrastructure they designed. they would have an
intrinsic motivation to ensure it works well. i am sure they could come up with
a long list of reasons why it would not suit them but so would anyone else. this
is why this requirement is needed: to design something that actually works.
</p>

<p>
note that i do not advocate against money or even against giving people free
money. i think that is all fine. what i argue for is that one should not require
money just to co-exist happily on this planet. it is useful for trading,
building new things. but humanity should have a minimum standard of living that
is not based on the fictional money but rather on the actual needs of the
planet&apos;s inhabitants. once most people have access to that, money can be seen as
a tool for the extra benefits society provides. until that happens, i will see
money as something to stress about.
</p>

<h2 id="hierarchies">hierarchies</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>shallow hiearchies are convenient.</p>
<p>
file hierarchies are an effective way to organize a large set of documents,
like, source code trees, personal files, photos or music collections. however i
often see quite deep hierarchies for these files. i think that is a bad idea.
the nesting should be quite shallow. most projects or organizations do not need
more than 2 levels. anything on top of that probably is not adding a lot of
value and is just making it harder to navigate said files.
</p>

<p>
if i need more than two levels then chances are i am better off with some sort
of database to categorize the files. let me take the hypothetical example of
organizing photos into a directory structure. you might start out with a
structure like this:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/[year]/[name of the event]/[device]/0001.jpg ... 9999.jpg
</pre>

<p>
so when i go skying and make one photo with a phone then two photos with a
camera, i would have these three files:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/2018/skying/phone/0001.jpg
 photos/2018/skying/camera/0001.jpg
 photos/2018/skying/camera/0002.jpg
</pre>

<p>
but would such organization give me any value? whenever i organize something
into directory, i ask myself: will i ever do an operation on all the files under
this directory but not on others? if the answer is no, then clearly i do not
need the extra directory. if the answer &quot;all the time&quot;, then a directory is a
good choice for the organization. if the answer is &quot;sometimes&quot; then it is a
tradeoff. how much annoyance am i adding to my day to day life by putting this
under a directory? i will need extra keypresses, clicks and mental effort
whenever i want to navigate to a set of pictures. it is a small extra cost but
over time it adds up so it is worth to consider.
</p>

<p>
in the above example i do not think that organizing based on the device matters
at all. why should care what device i used after 10 years? i probably long
forgotten about them. so i would get rid of the device directory. on the other
hand the name of the event does matter. i might often want to check out a
specific event i feel nostalgic about. the year is a bit trickier. i probably
will not care about it 99% of the times. i occasionally might want check what
events happened in a specific year but i do not think that i should organize my
files according to that use case. so in this case my structure would look like
this:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/[name of the event]/[timestamp].jpg
</pre>

<p>
so the listing of those 3 files would be the following:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/firstskying/20180112223456.jpg
 photos/firstskying/20180113144455.jpg
 photos/firstskying/20180113144523.jpg
</pre>

<p>
notice that since i can no longer rely on year to separate similar event, i had
to change the name of the event to something more memorable. i went for
&quot;firstskying&quot; in this example since it could represent the photos from my first
skying vacation. on linux i can still easily look up what vacations i went in a
specific year:
</p>

<pre>
 $ ls photos/*/2018* | cut -d2 -f2 | sort -u
</pre>

<p>
and the common task of &quot;look at all the photos from an event&quot; is also very easy:
</p>

<pre>
 $ [pictureapp] photos/firstskying/*
</pre>

<p>
if i were very fancy, i could even add additional tags to the photos (e.g. the
device that made the photo) and store all that in a lightweight database. then i
can use a rich query language to get a list of files for arbitrary conditions.
this solution still does not require directories and easily scales to arbitrary
number of tag types. suppose i add some tags to each photo and then store that
it a text file like this:
</p>

<pre>
 $ cat photodb
 photos/firstskying/20180112223456.jpg night friday phone skying ...
 photos/firstskying/20180113144455.jpg day saturday camera skying ...
 photos/firstskying/20180113144523.jpg day saturday camera skying ...
</pre>

<p>
then it is very easy to query for specific tags and then display just those.
e.g. i remember that i have a funny photo from one of the skying events that
happened on a friday night. then i can search for it like this:
</p>

<pre>
 [pictureapp] $(grep skying photodb | grep friday | grep night | cut -d&apos; &apos; -f1)
</pre>

<p>
probably i could make this a lot smarter and easier to use but the point stands
that if i have lots of documents, then i should not use the directory hierarchy
to over-organize them but rather use a specialized organizing tool or database.
</p>

<p>
in this example i went from 3 levels to 1 level. i find the one level
organization more helpful. it is much simpler, memorable and more accessible.
all it required is some active thought about organization.
</p>

<p>
reorganizing multi-person projects is a little bit trickier though. as an
individual project member i probably do not have a good insight how others use
the project. however we can use conway&apos;s law to help us. it states the
following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs
  which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
at first it sounds as something bad. but when i thought a little bit more about
this, i think this law is something i should embrace rather than work against.
suppose i have a news site and i want to track its source and content in a
monolithic version control system. this might be the hypothetical history of the
company:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i hire programmers to build an awesome webserver. they work under the
  /webserver directory.
</li><li>
  when the webserver is ready, they also write some scripts to run it. to not
  mix code and scripts, they split the files into /webserver/code and
  /webserver/scripts.
</li><li>
  over time running that awesome webserver turns out to be a lot of work, so i
  hire sysadmins to keep it up. these sysadmins also want to monitor the website
  so they split the scripts into /webserver/scripts/runscripts and
  /webserver/scripts/monitoring.
</li><li>
  i hire writers to write some content. they put their content under /content.
</li><li>
  i want the website to look fancy so i hire some ui designers who put their
  stuff under /webserver/frontend.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so i ended up with this hierarchy:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /content
</li><li>
  /webserver/code
</li><li>
  /webserver/frontend
</li><li>
  /webserver/scripts/runscripts
</li><li>
  /webserver/scripts/monitoring
</li>
</ul>

<p>
with such a hierarchy a significant portion of the project members have to deal
with the /webserver prefix daily completely unnecessary. so instead of
subdividing the project among the lines what sounds logical, i would divide it
along the team boundaries. that is what conway&apos;s law suggests if i twist it hard
enough. so i would have this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /content
</li><li>
  /frontend
</li><li>
  /scripts/runscripts
</li><li>
  /scripts/monitoring
</li><li>
  /webserver
</li>
</ul>

<p>
each team has its own top level directory under which they can do anything they
wish. most teams do not suffer the unnecessary burden of extra hierarchy. in
such situation if i get annoyed with an overly long path, it is only my team who
i need to convince to refactor the files. the changes under my team&apos;s directory
would not affect other teams too much. i can freely create directories under my
team&apos;s name, i do not need to concern about the fact whether it sounds logical
or not, or seek approvals from other teams. the hierarchy is not really getting
into my way, it is just a tool to divide the land of the shared file tree.
</p>

<p>
this approach leads to a very shallow directories with many entries. that sounds
like a nightmare to manage. but once i am over the initial shock, i actually
find it very efficient. i do not spend ages contemplating whether i should put
the logger.c file under the code/util directory or the code/system directory.
and i do not need remember where i put it either. if i am looking for it, i can
just do a &quot;ls *log*&quot; and find it quite quickly. no need for fancy recursive
searching.
</p>

<p>
a word of warning. i think symlinks should be avoided if possible. there is a
lot of value of every file having a unique path to it. if i start using
symlinks, i might start referring to some files through the symlink and that
would lead to bad habits. having unique paths to files makes referring to the
files clearer. if i use a symlink, i really want it to be obvious. maybe its
name should contain the fact that the file is a symlink, e.g. a .lnk extension.
this way there will be less confusion about the canonicality of a file. it will
be obvious from &quot;/runscripts.lnk/start.sh&quot; that this start.sh does not belong to
a &quot;runscripts&quot; team, it is just a shortened filename.
</p>

<p>
benefits of shallow hierarchies is not restricted to filesystems only. url
structures for websites should be quite shallow too. if i were to operate an
online store then i would keep my products at urls like myshop.com/1234578.
non-numbers would trigger searches. e.g. myshop.com/leather+shoe would search
for leather shoes. i think that is more usable than a url like
myshop.com/search?lang=en&amp;location=us&amp;num=20&amp;query=leather+shoes. the former is
easily to remember and share while the latter is a nightmare. i could type out
shareable links for that site without even needing to visit my url to verify
because its structure so simple. you can still create custom, non-search pages
if you put a slash at the end to indicate you are not trying to search. e.g.
myshop.com/login/ could go to the login page without confusing it with a search
query.
</p>

<p>
to sum all the above up: i prefer shallower directory structures because once i
am familiar with the environment, shallow structures make navigation easier for
me. if i find the shallow structure hard to navigate, i try to use a search tool
instead of making overly deep, hierarchical structures.
</p>


<p>
edit: i found nice motivational quote related to this article: &quot;in his 1970
classic work the feynman lectures on physics, feynman covered all of physics —
from celestial mechanics to quantum electrodynamics — with only two levels of
hierarchy.&quot; - think of this every time you create a system with deep
hierarchies.
</p>

<h2 id="challenges">challenges</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a way to test one's programming skills.</p>
<p>
i really liked puzzles and challenges as a kid. i participated in programming
competitions and some easier math ones as well. the problem with competitions
was that whenever i lost, i felt quite sad. especially if the competition had a
form of direct elimination. e.g. if i was not in the top n then i did not pass
to the next round. when i was eliminated then i felt dumb, i was not part of the
&quot;elite&quot;, i did not have the &quot;smarts&quot; to enter the next round. it was a very
discouraging feeling. however winning such competitions was an awesome feeling.
i felt proud of myself and even got prizes to boot.
</p>

<p>
interestingly, i had similar feelings about school exams. there too i felt the
dread and stress of failure. it might have been even worse a bit because even
though the bar was lower, the stakes were higher: if i fail, bad things will
happen to me. e.g. i get exposed to even more exams unvoluntarily. i tried to
ignore grades but i did felt pressure for good grades. so bad grades also made
me sad.
</p>

<p>
another frustrating part of these exercises is their randomness factor. i never
knew what to expect. especially bad were the ones where the examiner gave me a
random subject and then i had to talk just about that subject. what fascinates
me is that in such cases i always managed to get a subject i happened to know.
as my studies progressed, i even started to rely on this more and more and learn
less and less. this was very risky, yet my luck persisted.
</p>

<p>
now that school is over, i am no longer subject to these experiences. i miss
them a bit though. it is not the dread and stress i miss. it is not even the
sense of achievement i miss. if that would be the case then just competing and
succeeding in online programming competitions would give me the same dopamine
shot i am missing. yet they do not. i tried doing them but i simply did not have
the same motivation. i did not find them that much interesting. i do not think i
just &quot;grew up&quot;. i sort of feel the same as i was a kid. it is just my
environment and my interaction with it that completely changed. however if i
would get back into the same environment, i would probably enjoy the same things
as i enjoyed as a kid.
</p>

<p>
my childhood competitions and exams were in an environment of friends and
family. these people knew whenever i attended these exams and competitions. they
always asked about the results. when i got good results, i felt good about
myself because i understood that it meant something for these people. they might
have felt proud of me. i never bragged though. i just let people be naturally
curious (where were you yesterday?) and ask questions (oh really? how did you
fare?). i never liked to talk about myself so i tried to dismiss questions but
after enough nagging or some other ways (e.g. teacher announcing everyone&apos;s
results) people found out. i had this &quot;thing&quot; where i preferred that people find
out stuff about me from other ways than me talking about it. maybe this is a
form of signal that said person was so interested in me that they looked up or
asked information about me, remembered it and then asked me about it. a sort of
honest, non-fakeable flattery. it felt good. i guess i am a narcissist. but i am
digressing.
</p>

<p>
so achievements of exams and competitions felt good because i felt that i
impressed nearby friends and family. it was important that i impressed people i
knew. impressing strangers is boring. i mean just compare the following two
statements: &quot;a random korean guy won a starcraft competition&quot; vs &quot;your friend
won the bowling nationals&quot;. which one is more exciting? the latter excites me
more because then i want my friend to talk about it. the former i just simply do
not care about. now that i grew up, it is very hard to impress people, i do not
usually get such feedback. if i had some friends with whom i would continue to
do programming competitions, i think i would find it fun. but i am not a person
with many friends. it is not that people run away from me, it is more that i do
not even try acquire or meet people. anyways, digressing again.
</p>

<p>
even though this game is over for me, it does not mean i cannot create an
environment where people can acquire such experiences. however if i am going to
do this, i want to remove the elements of dread, stress, randomness, lost
opportunities and so on. at some point in my life (maybe when i am retired) i
would like to try creating a particular &quot;challenge&quot;. let me describe the rules
and then i will explain why i like the idea:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the challenge is to write a piece of software (solving a random collection of
  problems, e.g. given graph find shortest path, string manipulation, etc, stuff
  that i can easily verify).
</li><li>
  the challenge is static, never changes.
</li><li>
  the challenge is online, one can practice for it any way they wish.
</li><li>
  the taker must solve the challenge in barebones c programming language. the
  taker cannot even use the standard library (i provide a read and write
  function).
</li><li>
  the taker can attempt the challenge once every 3 months and it is free of
  charge.
</li><li>
  the takers must come to my house and use my restricted environment to take the
  challenge while i observe them so that they do not cheat.
</li><li>
  before attempting the challenge, the taker must send a fully correct solution
  to me. i need this to avoid situations where people come to me without any
  hopes to finish the challenge.
</li><li>
  at least one week before the first attempt, the taker must come to my house
  and do an exercise run. this ensures that the test takers are aware of the
  challenge&apos;s environment and gives me a way to become friends before i take on
  my adversial position as the challenge&apos;s proctor.
</li><li>
  the taker cannot use any helper material to complete the challenge other than
  the crappy computer i provide. not even a handwritten post-it note. i do
  provide a pen and paper for writing notes from scratch.
</li><li>
  the taker has 4 hours to complete the challenge. once they finish, i test
  their code and tell them if they passed or not. no bathroom breaks, drinking
  or anything allowed during those 4 hours (unless medical reasons).
</li><li>
  upon successfully completing the challenge, the taker&apos;s name will appear in
  the challenge&apos;s hall of fame. there would be also prices for the completers
  although age limited (e.g. prices only for &lt;= 16 years old). giving chocolate
  or something to middle aged people for completing a coding challenge seems
  weird.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i have not fully thought out the challenge but i think those rules achieve most
of the features i want the challenge to have. here are my reasons why i would
like this challenge as a taker:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i know what the challenge asks. i know if i am prepared for the challenge or
  not. i do not need to stress about &quot;what are they going to ask me?&quot;.
</li><li>
  the challenge&apos;s result does not depend on other people. if i pass, i am on the
  hall of fame regardless of others.
</li><li>
  the programming environment is very simple, very equalizing. since i cannot
  use the standard library, i know that i do not need to stress about memorizing
  the parameter order of qsort. i just need to learn qsort itself. maybe it is
  harder but i feel better if i know qsort&apos;s algorithm rather than just the
  argument order.
</li><li>
  because i can retry in short period of time, the failure is not a big deal.
  there are no limits on the amount of retries. i can keep trying until i
  succeed. and whether i succeed or not, depends only on my willpower, i do not
  lose anything even if it takes me 5 years to succeed.
</li><li>
  since there is a cooldown period between attempts, i have a chance to really
  think through my next attempt rather than just brute forcing through the
  challenge.
</li><li>
  since the challenge occurs in a very controlled environment, i know that every
  member of the hall of fame went through the same process as i did. i know
  there are no cheaters among them, and i know that others also know that i
  cannot be a cheater.
</li><li>
  the challenge is geographically limited so it is not something anybody can do.
  the hall of fame will not be filled with random people all around the world
  that i cannot possibly know. in fact since only close people can do it
  (especially thanks to the silly 1 week exercise run), it is highly likely that
  the people on the hall of the fame are people i can befriend or just go and
  visit. then i can ask for their advice. doing this in the real world rather
  than through anonymous online discussions is much more satisfying. even if i
  communicate via email, just knowing that the other side is near me makes
  things more satisfying.
</li><li>
  since the challenge does not allow any helping tools or materials, all i can
  fall back to is myself. there is no greater equalizer than stripping ourselves
  from our tools and resources. this way i know that all the hall of fame
  members all only used only their minds. i do not need to stress whether i have
  the best books with me or not, or whether my notes contain everything or not.
  it is just me and the challenge.
</li><li>
  4 hours is limit i need to work with. it is something to which i have to adapt
  my bodily functions. i feel i need to urinate in a higher frequency, well, i
  have all the more motivation to work faster.
</li><li>
  once i finish the challenge, i appear on the hall of the fame. if the
  challenge is hard enough so that only a few people are on it, then randomly
  meeting my fellow hall of famers at some random future point is a great
  bonding opportunity. i now immediately have a common topic i can rant about
  and ask the other person&apos;s experience of the challenge. it is also a nice
  feeling if my non-programming peers find it and then start asking about it.
</li><li>
  there is one perverse incentive with the age limited prices. maybe the price
  is a bike that the kids do not really need since they sit at home all day
  long. even if i cannot get the price anymore directly, i could still strike a
  deal with kids that i will prepare them for the challenge in exchange they
  give up the price (or a portion of the price) for me. this way i would have an
  incentive to train the next generation for the challenge.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so that would be my idea. the challenge itself is not very practical. but i do
not think everything in life must be strictly practical. it is a game. no need
to play if it does not sound interesting.
</p>

<p>
ideally when i retire, i will do so in a small city and could run such a
challenge from my home mostly for the nearby kids. maybe i could present
multiple challenges with varying difficulties and then advertise the challenge
in the local school. it would be completely optional, i would not expect too
many kids to try. however i can play with the prizes. if nobody attempts, i can
just keep raising the prize until a few kids get so obsessed with it that they
will start training for the challenge. it is an easy way to get some people
motivated to do something i want. there is not much point to this other than
getting onto the hall of fame. however if they manage to get there, they might
get interested in other, more mature competitions and this might kickstart their
interest in computer science.
</p>

<p>
since i think i would be pretty comfortable with such challenges, i wonder if
similar conditions could apply to school exams. i could split school exams into
two categories: the mandatory exams and the extracurricular exams. both types
would be binary: pass or fail. there is no grading. however there would be no
punishment for failing. they could just retry 3 months later. the mandatory
exams would be super basic: it is just to confirm that they can read, write,
count, know the basics of ethics (do not hurt others), know some basic stuff
about everyday life (monetary skills like avoiding credit or the concept of
interest rates), some basic life skills (cooking an egg). the extracurricular
exams would be about history, algebra, literature, programming, sewing, cooking,
woodworking and others (each subject would have multiple exams with varying
difficulties). kids could do the exams any time they want, in any order (as long
as they take at least 1 each month for instance). the nice thing is that then
the kids can direct their knowledge intake as they wish. if they do not have
preference, others can suggest them exams to take. the learning part of the
studies is left to the kids to figure out. sure, they can attend classes but if
they feel they can go faster than the rest, they can just take the exams sooner
and not bother with the classes. and just to make sure kids have an incentive
for collaborating, they could have random study groups where all members have to
pass a specific exam. the study group members now have to branch out subjects
outside their interest. if a member is not interested in the subject at all, the
other study group members must somehow work with the disinterested kid to
convince and teach the kid about the subject for the greater good. they have to
do so because the rule would be to not allow the study members take more exams
until they get everyone on their group to pass the random exam. anyways, i am
just rambling random ideas. the point is, rather than forcing a very strict
curriculum and punishing failure, i would much prefer to give more choice for
kids to pursue education in the areas they like and at the pace they want, have
easier and less stressful exams (they are kids afterall) and avoid punishment
for failing exams but rather teach to keep trying, regardless of failures.

<h2 id="efficiency">efficiency</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>focusing on efficiency leads to complexity.</p>
<p>
it is very easy for me to fall into the trap of obsessing about efficiency.
efficiency can mean many things: in software i might be optimizing for minimal
ram usage, minimal time use, or in real world i might be optimizing to spend as
little money as possible. however achieving peak efficiency has downsides. the
principle of pareto efficiency suggests that the more efficient i make
something, i lose optimality in other dimensions. the principle introduces the
concept of pareto frontier: when i am on the frontier any improvement in my
preferred dimension will result in decline in some other dimension. examples:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i want my software to use very little memory. but to achieve this i would need
  to use very complex data structures and thus maintaing the software would be a
  nightmare.
</li><li>
  i am a baker and i want to bake bread as cheap as possible. therefore i will
  look for the cheapest flour possible. but such flour makes my bread taste and
  smell bad. i compensate by adding even more cheap additives. now i am not
  selling bread anymore just a bread-like hodgepodge.
</li><li>
  i want to commute to work in minimal time possible. so i take a bike instead
  of walking. but now i have to bike next to the traffic and as such it is super
  stressful. i am exposing myself to a lot of stress in exchange of less time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i am not saying that i should embrace inefficiency but rather just to avoid the
obsession to be at the frontier. it is much easier to adapt to the changing
world when i have a lot of wiggle room. this leads me to the next question: why
the obsession about the efficiency?
</p>

<p>
suppose i am a big company. i make 100 million dollars yearly. if i hire a
person that can make 1% improvement to my processes then that means i can now
make 101 million dollars yearly. that is 1 million dollars worth of extra money
in exchange for one person&apos;s salary. sure, it adds complexity to my processes
but that person can deal with it so it is a sound tradeoff.
</p>

<p>
other examples: i am a farmer and improving crop efficiency means i can feed
more people. or improving fuel efficiency means less pollution. in many the
other cases like these the benefits do outweigh the downsides. but it is
important to be aware of those downsides.
</p>

<p>
the common theme i see is that efficiency starts to matter mostly in large
systems where even the smallest improvements lead to large, quantifiable
differences. the same system can also afford the kafkaesque complexity stemming
from all the small efficiency &quot;improvements&quot;. but when other people try to use
or rely on the output of that system then they are inadvertently exposed to the
risks stemming from all that complexity.
</p>

<ul><li>
  in the software&apos;s case i would get giant, unmaintainable codebases. i would be
  discouraged to even attempt fixing bugs in software because i do not know
  where to even start or my machine is not powerful to build the software in
  question.
</li><li>
  in the crops case i might get more confident about my farming abilities and
  start growing a single plant with great efficiency. the risk here is that a
  lot of people might start depending on me solely. if some unforeseen problem
  arises with my plant and i lose a year&apos;s worth of crop that will expose all
  those people to huge amount of risk. in the case where i am forced to keep a
  large variety of plants with various successes it would keep people&apos;s
  expectations in check.
</li><li>
  or take the fuel efficiency example: it means that more people can afford
  personal cars, less pollution means less people will be advocating against
  cars, which means there is the chance that there will be a demand for even
  more cars and in total there will be more pollution by making all those cars.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
although i enjoy the efficiencies of the modern world but when it comes to my
own projects, i stopped caring about efficiency and optimality. my new focus is
to not let things grow unbounded. i set arbitrary limits on myself or on the
software i write and i adhere to them. when i reach a limit somewhere, i take a
deep look to see if i can solve the problem in a different way so that i do not
need to increase the limit. this approach lets me avoid being stuck in some
local minima and reach much higher efficiencies in total. for example if i have
a simple software that only solves 80% of my usecase, i will try changing my
usecase rather than grabbing a more complex software. usually my environment
gets simpler in exchange. for instance if all i want to have a blog with some
text in it, i can just write simple text files rather than html or other
complicated markup that needs various postprocessing before i can serve them.
this way i do not need to deal with fonts, css, hyperlinks and whatnot. only the
important bit, the text itself, remains. and most important observation from
this is that when i avoid the unnecessary fluff, things get miraculously
efficient. for instance this website loads quite fast without any effort on my
side. no need to set up compression or use fancy protocols to make it fast.
</p>

<p>
i am pretty sure the efficiency stemming from limits extends to other cases too.
if we did not have that much cars available, people would be more dependent on
public transportation so the planet in total would be more efficient. or if less
food would be available, we would have also less waste so probably we would try
to be more conscious about food. of course we would have harder, less convenient
life but potentially more efficient in exchange. this might not sound appealing
for everyone but i think applying some limits on ourselves might get us some
improvements and efficiencies in exchange without an explicit focus on
efficiency itself.
</p>

<h2 id="motivation">motivation</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>i'm way too lazy.</p>
<p>
some days i struggle to get myself to do anything at all. i wake up, do my daily
routines but then i spend most of my time with work related stuff like reading
and responding to emails. when i get home i play with family and afterwards i go
to bed and sleep until tomorrow. i do not spend time on hobby projects or on
learning new stuff. weekends are not more productive either. when i was a kid, i
found computer programming quite fun and exciting. i enjoyed solving project
euler puzzles, acm style programming competition problems and writing small
tools here and there. in order to do those i needed to learn about math,
algorithms, programming languages and best practices, operating systems, english
language and many other topics. but today? i feel like i am not learning new
things. that would be fine as long as i would be working on something meaningful
instead, harvesting all the knowledge. that is not happening either. it is like
my time is flying by and i do not have anything to show up in exchange. i am not
investing my time into anything.
</p>

<p>
there are a few differences in my current life compared to my kid life though.
when i was a kid i had a lot more free time. i was much earlier home compared to
my typical work day. when i was home, i had private room where people left me
alone so i could do anything without disturbances. today i do not have any
privacy. at work i am in an open plan office and at home i have my computer in
the living room so that i do not isolate myself too much from others. this makes
concentration harder especially if others are doing distracting activities. this
somewhat explains why i feel i have little free time and the easier
distractability but it does not explain the lack of motivation i am feeling.
</p>

<p>
to clarify this lack of motivation is not depression. i do not feel depressed.
it is more like i feel that everything that is important already exists so i do
not see the need to create more software. now that i grew up and got a broad
enough overview about the software field, i feel like the software world hit a
plateau in the late 1980s as people finished implementing all the obvious
software and today&apos;s software and computing is just mostly fluff. i feel like we
are over-softwarizing our environment where all we would need is just saner
practices or solutions and then we would not need said software. it is probably
better to leave this topic for a separate blog entry in the future for now as it
is off topic.
</p>

<p>
it is not only software i am not that much interested though. achieving anything
for me is a burden. let it be exercise, cooking, cleaning. to compensate i just
avoid having bad habits and thus i do not have problems with health or
messiness. i walk to the office, i keep a super clean desk, i do not smoke, i do
not drink alcohol or sugary drinks, i do not buy crap i do not need, i do not
even have money on me most of the time and so on.
</p>

<p>
yet i still function. i can still keep my job, i still occasionally make a tool
for myself, clean the house, or just generally keep myself alive. how so? i am
definitely not intrinsically motivated to do these things. the motivation comes
from external sources. it is either something annoying me or somebody nagging
me. if i am annoyed with a flaky or inflexible tool, i am somewhat inclined to
write my own version of it. if somebody is pestering me about something, i am
somewhat inclined to do what they want to stop them from pestering me. the
latter has a quite a strong effect on me. if somebody sends me a message, i have
this very strong urge to always have the last word. it is almost and ocd like
tick. if that message has a simple request or a question, i have an urge to do
whatever it asked me or come up with a very good reason why i cannot do it.
these two things get me through my life these days. if the toilet is so dirty
that i am annoyed then i clean it. if at work somebody assigns me a small bug to
fix, i fix it.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand if the floor is only a little dirty, i will probably not do
anything about it. i am not annoyed so it is fine as it is. as for the second
case: if at work somebody assigns me a big project that needs a lot of
consideration and coordination, i am at a loss. driving such work requires a lot
of inner motivation which i lack. in such cases i rely on having management
aiding me. talking through a project with another person, splitting it into
smaller pieces and then having a manager pestering me about it really does help
me. it is no wonder rubber duck debugging is a thing, it is just that a rubber
duck is not as motivating as a human could be.
</p>

<p>
i recently came across the concept of &quot;accountability partner&quot;. once you find a
partner, both of you agree to a set of goals, you keep periodically reporting to
each other about the progress of your goals and keep each other accountable for
those goals. it is similar to coaching. i think the difference is that while a
coach coaches you, you do not really give anything in return while you do
provide value for your accountability partner. the latter does not feel too much
of a one sided burden. if i were to stop adhering to my goals, that might make
the partner also stop adhering which would make me feel guilty so i am
personally incentivized to adhere to my goals. basically this is setting up the
nagging feeling for myself. i have not really tried this. if i ever find myself
wanting to do a small project, i would totally try this. now if only i had
friends for this. maybe acquiring more friends should be one project. oh well,
something to think about.
</p>

<p>
so to sum up: i am no longer motivated intrinsically about things like when i
was a kid. i can get around this by having an environment that still motivates
me extrinsically to do things that i really need to get done. however it does
not really lead to working on original, novel things. for that i have no
solution.
</p>

<h2 id="boy">boy</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a story about growing up.</p>
<p>
boy&apos;s life started out quite simple. he lived in a small farming town, he was
surrounded by loving and supporting family. he spent most of his early days
either fooling around with neighbor&apos;s grandchildren outside whenever they were
around or just watching television. he liked watching sci-fi shows. as time
passed, he started nagging his parents for a computer because that is what he
has seen a lot in the tv shows. the parents were financially strapped so it took
them a while but they eventually found someone with a very old computer that
they wanted to throw out. boy got his first second hand computer. he fell in
love with it. he spent a lot of time with it. he was playing video games and
also learning programming in the hopes creating new games. as time went on he
grew apart from the neighbor&apos;s grandchildren since they started to spend less
and less time around. to understand the computers better boy started attending a
extracurricular computer class. he managed to find a friend there who also liked
to play video games. he befriended him and they visited each other often to play
games.
</p>

<p>
boy spent most of his teenage years in a single school. for 8 years he studied
with the same set of roughly 20 people. his classmates were nice people, they
liked each other. boy was friendly and a relatively good student. he liked
attending school. he liked its relatively rigid structure. he went in the
morning, attended the classes and then went home. he was a person of habits so
this worked well. nothing extraordinary happened in his life and he was happy
like that. he kept learning about computers privately. he wanted to become the
best programmer in the world. he thought that when he reaches the ultimate
computer mastery then fame and fortune will follow and everything will be okay.
he spent most of his afterschool time alone in his private room fooling around
with his computer.
</p>

<p>
he started noticing something during his late teenager years. more and more of
his classmates started hating school. some of them even skipped some of the
classes. some of them started going to pubs or just generally hang around after
the school. this was odd to him but he kept enjoying school and always went home
to his computer afterwards. on some occassions he went along with others into
pubs to see what was it all about. every time he did so he found himself in a
completely new environment with many strangers all talking. he did not like the
situation. all he could think of is going back to his more familiar places. the
topics people talked about were all sorts of things boy had no experience with.
music, dating, talking about other people. people drank alcohol and smoked
cigarettes. boy completely refused to do those things since he was afraid those
acts might interfere with his goal of infallible mental acuity needed for being
the best programmer. he completely avoided going to such places. he continued to
stay at home outside school.
</p>

<p>
during his teenager years he continued the playdates with his video game friend.
when they got a bit older, that friend introduced porn to boy. friend brought
some porn pictures on a floppy disk. boy did not understand it first. so friend
decided to do something that really surprised boy: he started masturbating in
front of him. he finished with an ejaculation which was also a completely new
thing he knew nothing about. friend then said that boy should try this too, it
will be fun. boy got curious and said sure and asked for instructions. there
they were, two adolescent boys, showing their penises to each other and trying
to masturbate. this was the first time boy remembers seeing another penis. he
might have glanced one or two in the past but this was the first time he had a
chance to actually take a more detailed look. boy had his own penis right there
to compare. it looked different. the foreskin on boy&apos;s penis did not cover his
glans. friend&apos;s foreskin could stretch long enough to cover that part. boy then
suddenly remembered that he had a surgery on his penis when he was a kid. his
parents were sometimes questioning him whether he can &quot;pull off his skin&quot; there
or not. he was quite shy person so when the parents insisted on showing it, he
just quickly showed that no, he cannot do that. they took him to a doctor who
signed him up for a surgery. boy did not really understand the whole thing that
is happening around him. he noticed that his penis looks a bit different after
the surgery but he did not think of it much and soon has forgotten about it. as
boy explains this to friend, boy gets a bit scared about it. did the doctors
actually mutilate his penis? friend immediately calms him down that this is
nothing to worry about, it is not that important part of the penis. then he
instructs boy that he should start stroking itself. boy does but nothing much
happens. he does not feel much. his friend plays videogames in the meantime. boy
keeps stroking penis as his friend recommends. nothing happened at that point so
after a while boy stopped and continued playing video games as if nothing
happened.
</p>

<p>
the penis difference kept bugging him. around that time his school got internet
access so he picked a quiet, private corner machine in the computer lab and
started researching penises. he learned that the operation he had was a
circumcision. he learned that while it is common in some cultures, it is not
common where he is coming from. the feeling he got is that circumcision is
associated with a stigma. the idea was that it was something that only an
unrespected ethnic group did to their babies so if people were to figure out
that he is circumcised then they would make fun out of him and would outcast
him. boy felt ashamed about this part of him. he felt that this is something he
must hide from others.
</p>

<p>
as most teenager boys, boy kept playing with his penis now and then. eventually
he managed to get his first ejaculation. then porn started getting more and more
interesting. friend brought even more porn for him. they even masturbated
together. porn was exciting for boy. after a while it was not really the sexual
act that he found most interesting in it. it was the fact that the people in
porn could completely disrobe in front of each other without any shame. it was
something he could not imagine comfortable doing himself due to his fear of
shame. being naked became a symbol of power for him. he wanted to be able to do
what people in porn do. being naked in front of others, being comfortable with
the raw human bodies and let him explore other people&apos;s bodies and let others
explore his. his porn taste was quite soft compared to what was available. all
he was interested in was casual nudity. his environment was quite conservative,
he did not experience much nudity which made him even more thirstier. in reality
he spent most of his time at home, he did not even have the chance to see others
in nude, and he did not have the chance to show off himself. though he did not
want to show off himself due to his inhibitions. he did not talk about this to
anyone. he managed to get through high school keeping all this to himself
without ever satisfying his curiosity.
</p>

<p>
years passed and boy finished his high school and off he went to a big city to
study computers in a prestigious university and to experience new adventures.
boy entered the real world. he did not really knew anyone in this new place. the
university classes were differently structured than his high school. no longer
was the case that a specific group is glued together for long hours and are
forced to work together every day. it was the wild west, everyone was for
themselves. the only thing that saved him was his interest in computer
competitions that he started doing in his high school times. he always done well
in them. he wanted to continue them in his university. the most prestigious
contest required teams with 3 members. he managed to find two other people for
this. during his high school years boy was active on a computer forum where he
liked to help people. by luck he managed to befriend one person there who
happened to start university at the same time as he was. he found another one by
looking at past high school competitions to see if there are high achievers in
his classes. boy then took the strength and asked one of them to join his team.
and so he found a few friends with whom he continued to attend competitions and
classes. later they even became roommates in the university&apos;s cheap dormitories.
</p>

<p>
the first three years of the university were quite busy, much busier than high
school so that kept boy quite occupied. since dormitories offered 4 person
rooms, he did not have much privacy either. he got through these years quite
quickly. his fantasies and inhibitions did not change. he was still super shy so
avoided anything that might expose him. much like in high school he also avoided
all social gatherings. he did not really miss them since he got plenty social
interactions from university and roommates. by the end of the third year he also
realized that becoming the best programmer was not realistic. in this place he
was not the brightest person anymore. this demotivated him. he started caring
about grades an his studies even less. he was still a good student but became a
lazy one. this and the unfulfilled fantasies made life look bleak to him.
</p>

<p>
since boy was already quite familiar with computers by the time he got to the
university, he managed to find a summer internship place in a nearby big,
multinational company. he worked there each summer since his first university
break. the company quite liked him so boy agreed to start working part time when
he started his fourth year at university. he got disillusioned with the
university so he liked this offer. at the same time that year he did not get a
place in the dormitory. he was now on his own. when he got the rejection letter
from the dormitory, he got a bit scared. he thought maybe he should rent a place
since he is now making money anyways. he started looking at rentals, picked the
first nearby, nice looking studio apartment and quickly moved in. he did not
give it much thought but it worked out well. he got a nice place. he liked it.
he was alone. he got back his privacy. he could do anything without anyone
looking. the shared living at a dormitory started bugging him anyways due to the
incompatible waking hours some roommates lived by.
</p>

<p>
his daily habit was to go to university for a few classes, then go to work for a
few hours and then go home. as weeks passed his disillusion with life and the
unfulfilled fantasies started growing. since boy was not spending much time in
university anymore, he grew apart from his friends. whenever he got home he
started wondering what is he doing with his life. interests in computers started
fading. there was not much point to it since he felt that there was not much
that he could contribute to the world anymore. there are smarter people around
for that and that is fine. most people around that time also had girlfriends,
were having fun and yet here he was as a virgin, he had not even seen real naked
woman in his life. he did not like the idea of visiting escorts because he was
still ashamed of himself. he felt like he could only share himself with a person
he knows well. he wanted a girlfriend, a person with whom he could share
anything, he wanted a family around himself. some days he went home, to his
lonely studio and he went straight to bed and cried himself into sleep because
nothing made sense for him, he could not see a future for himself.
</p>

<p>
boy was quite the lucky person. he had an easy life. parents provided well for
him. they did not give him everything he wanted but he got the things he really
wanted. he lucked out schools too. he was not bullied, he was around friendly
people. he lucked out exams too. he never studied very thoroughly but during
exams he always managed to randomly pick a topic he knew well so he managed to
slide through high schools and university exams without ever failing an exam.
his sheer luck also helped to meet the right person at the right time. on one
random day at his second university year he was sitting in the university&apos;s
lounge area with a concerned look on his face. a girl classmate was sitting next
to him. she keenly observed the distress and asked boy what is nagging him. boy
explained that last summer he worked in a summer internship and now he is
expected to file tax reports. boy had no idea what to do and he was not sure who
to ask about it. the girl in question, luckily for boy, happened to have an
accountant degree already. girl volunteered to help boy out. boy got super happy
about this. girl also happened to live in the same dormitory as boy. all he had
to do is go down a few floors in the evening, hand over the necessary documents
and let girl figure out the rest. life could not be easier. since she was the
first girl he talked to since he came to university, he wanted to have more
interactions with her. boy took a big breath and told girl that if she ever
needs help with her classes, he is happy to help out. it took a lot of courage
for boy to say this since he feared rejection. girl said thanks, she might get
back to boy later. she did so eventually. boy went over to her room quite a few
times to help with homework. girl had a boyfriend already in her hometown so boy
did not think of this relationship much. he really liked the fact that he can be
around a girl. boy also liked a roommate of girl&apos;s since she had qualities boy
could empathize with. roommate was smart, quiet, shy and friendly sounding. boy
felt the same about himself so she liked roommate. boy did not meet roommate a
lot though since girl and boy usually went to a more private areas to not
disturb the other two roommates and that they do not disturb them. boy was quite
shy in front of others anyways so he preferred it this way. not much more
happened between between girl and boy during those early years. boy happened to
hang around girl whenever she needed some help and girl helped out with boy&apos;s
tax documents once every year.
</p>

<p>
this relationship persisted even in the fourth academic year during boy&apos;s
depression. since neither of them were in dormitory anymore, they did their
occasional meetings in university lounges. girl was living at her relatives. boy
was reluctant to invite girl to his apartment to avoid looking like a creep who
is trying to hit on girls with boyfriends. eventually the topic came up, boy
told girl he is now renting a studio, and after another courage gathering
session he asked that she might as well come over there. to boy&apos;s surprise girl
agreed. girl started to come over to boy&apos;s place every few evening to study
together. some evenings she went home quite late. since she was already over to
boy&apos;s place and did not feel like going home, boy and girl watched movies
together or boy was showing off some magic tricks he learned on the internet.
what boy did not realize at that time is that girl dumped his boyfriend a few
months back. she even told this to boy once but it flew past boy&apos;s ears. one day
boy was chatting with girl on instant messaging. in that conversation girl got
tired and asked to have sex already. this request came when boy was deepest in
his depression. girl did not know about boy&apos;s depression. that day boy did not
cry. all he could think of is girl&apos;s message, seeing an actual woman naked, a
woman seeing him naked, and the fact that he can have his first sexual
experience. when boy got back his senses from the message, his body shame jumped
right back into his mind. after a few confirmational queries about his
understanding of the original message, he told girl he is circumcised and asked
how big of a deal that is. girl told him that such things do not bother her. she
then carefully asked if the circumcision was due to medical or other reasons.
this question did not bother boy, nor would any answer bother girl but it
confirmed for boy that indeed people in his area do associate circumcision with
ethnic rituals.
</p>

<p>
next time girl came over to boy&apos;s place, they did not bother with the studies.
they just lied on the bed. boy asked if he could kiss girl. she said yes. they
kissed. boy asked girl if she could take off her shirt. girl was a bit
uncomfortable with this but she agreed. boy asked the same about her bra. girl
was even more uncomfortable with this but eventually she agreed. boy could see
and touch real boobs the first time in his life. he was very happy. he enjoyed
the moment. boy asked about taking off the pants. girl said no. then they just
continued lying next to each other. boy was curious, he continued to pester
girl. he asked if he could at least touch her vulva. girl reluctantly agreed.
boy slided his hand into girl&apos;s pants. he touched it. he explored the vulva. it
was moist. he then pulled his hand back and put his fingers to his nose. he
examined it carefully. he even tasted it just to be sure since he was not sure
if opportunity will last or not. his hand then wandered back into the pants. boy
continued his blind vulva exploration. his curiosity grew. he asked again about
taking off the pants. girl agreed this time. boy did not hesitate, he took it
off. he liked what he was seeing. he examined his discovery from a very close
perspective. he immediately felt the need to use more senses for this
exploration like taste. he slowly started approached his target, and felt it all
around. he continued this exploration. girl was not objecting. after a few
minutes girl came. girl pushed away boy&apos;s face to stop boy&apos;s eagerness. she had
to rest. the fun was over for boy. hugging and silence followed the fun. girl
thanked boy and said that it is getting late, she should go home. she then
slowly got dressed and boy escorted her home.
</p>

<p>
boy was super happy. he now had a friend who fully trusted him with her body. he
felt like his fantasy came true. though it was not the full experience for him
since his penis had to remain at its dark place last time. however he knew that
the time is close. he will get to show off, use his penis and experience sex
too. boy walked around satisfied and excited about the future. he knew that more
adventure is around the corner. soon, girl was at boy&apos;s studio again. over
instant messaging boy convinced girl that they should have real sex next time.
he also asked girl to have low expectations, he never did such things, he will
probably utterly fail. this time both were ready to have sex. boy quickly
undressed girl. he played around her body again since boy&apos;s fascination with
bodies did not diminish. after a while boy also decided to undress, put on a
condom, and try to fumble his penis into girls vulva. he went in and minutes if
not seconds later he came. he had his first sex. he was a bit underwhelmed
though. partly because of his premature ejaculation, partly because of his
expectations. boy thought having his penis in a vulva will make the orgasm a
completely different, more extraordinary feeling. it was the same bodily feeling
as the old ejaculations he had. the difference this time was that he was with
another person. he still very much enjoyed it but in a different way. his penis,
his erect penis, the ejaculation to boy were increasingly more and more private
aspects of life. but here it was happening next to, inside another person&apos;s most
private body part. to boy this represented a very deep, trusting bond with the
other person. he did not care about the orgasm much, he cared about the intimacy
he managed experience that day. that is what he felt most satisfied about. sex
was a way to achieve that deep intimacy boy was longing for. hugging and
relaxation followed.
</p>

<p>
girl kept going to boy&apos;s place and they kept having sex in similar ways. boy
tried experimenting a little bit to see what differences are there to the
experience. boy was elated. after a short while he asked girl to have a shared
shower. boy wanted this so that he can show his body fully girl. so far girl did
not really see boy&apos;s body. while girl was lying on the bed, boy had to do
everything himself. he undressed himself, put his penis inside her, then later
cleaned up himself. during these acts girl did not stare at boy&apos;s crotch much.
he wanted to make himself easier to observe. they had their shower. boy proudly
showed presented himself to girl. girl was a bit shy but otherwise acted
completely casual. boy was completely mesmerized with girl&apos;s body. he could not
keep of his eyes of girl&apos;s body, he was mentally trying to crystallize the
experience into his memory. they showered together all right but to boy it did
not feel like girl is giving him as much attention as he is giving her. boy felt
the lack of interest but the possibility of being fearlessly naked and having
the possibility of freely explore girl&apos;s body overshadowed the lack of the
reciprocal feeling.
</p>

<p>
as boy got more experience in sex, his performance improved, sex was great.
everything worked like in the movies. girl continued to show generally less
lustful interest in boy&apos;s body. slowly boy understood that this was not due to
his body not being attractive but it was due to girl not as interested in nudity
itself. she had a different love language. boy did not feel fully satisfied. he
did not even fully stop with his porn addiction. his fantasies continued. he did
not hide this fact from girl. boy was super honest. girl did not really mind
that boy still looks at porn after boy fully explained how he thought. boy
really liked the fact that he can share any uncomfortable thoughts with girl and
that the girl accepts those without judgment. such unconditional acceptance was
part of his fantasy after all. even without the fully satisfied fantasies boy no
longer felt depressed. boy was happy. future was now full of possibilities.
</p>

<p>
girl started spending more and more time at boy&apos;s place. she even started
sleeping there overnight. boy liked girl and he liked that she spends so much
time with him. boy even fantasized growing old and having a family with girl.
after a while they wanted move together but girl did not really like boy&apos;s
studio because she did not like having everything in one big room. boy&apos;s rent
was quite high too. girl was thinking about renting a bigger and cheaper
apartment. meanwhile girl asked if her former roommate boy liked could sleep one
night there. roommate was also rejected from dormitory so she was sharing a flat
with 3 other girls. suddenly their landlords decided that they do not want to
rent their flat out anymore. she needed a new place quickly and she needed a
place to stay until she found a new place. boy immediately agreed. sleeping next
to two girls he really liked sounded like a dream coming true. boy had his
sleepover pajama party at its place. it was not terribly exciting since nothing
happened but the fact that both girl and roommate trusted him enough to sleep in
the same bed as him was a very comforting experience. girl slept in the middle
so there was no chance for funny business. this way girl did not really mind the
setup for a day. next day roommate explained that she needs to find a place not
only for herself but also for her sister so she was not sure what she is going
to do. boy, girl, and roommate knew each other for a while now and they liked
each other. girl proposed that maybe they should band together and rent a place
together. everybody agreed. girl and roommate hit the internets to find places
and started visiting apartments. boy did not really care much where he lived so
he let them do whatever they wanted. he had to go to university and then to work
anyways. the girls quickly found a nice 2 bedroom place and the next day all
four of them, sister included, visited and agreed to their new place where they
planned to spend most of their upcoming days.
</p>

<p>
the apartment was long and narrow. it had 4 rooms next to each other. bathroom,
bedroom 1, bedroom 2, kitchen. flatmate and sister lived in bedroom 1. in order
to get from bedroom 1 to kitchen, one had to go through bedroom 2. boy and girl
lived in bedroom 2. in order to go from bedroom 2 to bathroom, one had to go
through bedroom 1. unless one was alone, there was no real privacy for anyone.
girl&apos;s former roommate now became flatmate. boy did not really know flatmate&apos;s
sister until they actually moved in. he worried about this a bit. flatmate
previously explained sister is like her but younger so if he likes flatmate, he
will like sister too. this turned out to be true. boy noticed minor differences
though. sister was a bit less shy, more confident, she looked like she knew what
she wanted, like she had her whole life planned out. boy and sister liked each
other but boy liked flatmate better since he felt more commonality with her. boy
felt that flatmate is also a little bit lost and misunderstood in life so they
exchanged banter about who is more clueless in life.
</p>

<p>
everybody was happy with the arrangement, everybody liked each other. there were
no quarrels, group members did not annoy each other. nobody was the party type
person so everyone had sane waking hours. days, weeks, months passed. boy
continued to have great relationship with girl along with great sex life.
however boy still did not really feel that his fantasies were fully met. he was
still in his first love&apos;s high, he was happy enough so he did not mind that
much. he kept consuming porn to make up the void. as summer approached, the
outside temperature kept rising. the apartment was cheap because it lacked a few
things like air conditioning. it was quite hot inside as well. everyone was
sweating like pigs. boy started hanging out in his underwear. flatmate started
hanging out in a bikini swimming suit too. girl and sister did not really like
dressing down so they kept themselves fully clothed. they did not mind others
hanging out half naked. boy liked the lack of air conditioning because he liked
what he was seeing: a barely covered body of a close friend. boy was confused
though. he was looking at forbidden fruit. he did not know what to do so he just
discretely feasted his eyes on flatmate&apos;s body. as the rapport between boy and
flatmate grew, they became more playful with each other. boy&apos;s favorite game was
a tickling battle. boy could touch flatmate&apos;s in a playful matter. it was
exciting for him. at the same time this was not sexual so there was no anxiety
about doing the wrong thing in this play.
</p>

<p>
a year passed, boy liked his situation but he still felt unfulfilled. he wanted
more intimacy. he wanted to show and see more. boy learned from flatmate that
she did not really like to be nude. she does not have a problem with others
being naked around her although she is not that keen into being around naked
people. boy asked girl if he can hang around naked around flatmate. girl was not
comfortable with that so she said that he should not. boy respected her request.
this bugged boy. he really wanted to open up his body to flatmate. he wanted the
flatmate to validate his imperfect body. out of desperation he started to act in
a very creepish ways. he tried to sit in ways where his underwear does not fully
cover his crotch area, to make it look like his penis accidentally slipped out.
he wanted flatmate to catch his wardrobe malfunction. it was not terribly
effective. he was not even sure what he was trying to achieve. the tickling
battles and other games did continue, especially when only two of them were at
home. this started to became harder and harder for boy. boy was so obsessed
about flatmate that whenever they started playing, boy got an erection. boy was
super shy about this. he felt that he has to hide this from flatmate lest she
thinks boy wants sex and then she distances herself from boy. boy often had to
hold back in the games until his erection passed and only then continue playing.
hiding his thoughts, his body and his bodily reactions from flatmate felt wrong
but he did not want to make the whole thing weirder as it was already. he had it
way too good, did not want to risk pushing his relationship with flatmate
further.
</p>

<p>
boy finished his university studies at the end of his fifth university year. he
went working full time. his workplace insisted that he goes for a 3 month
training at a very far away place, a different continent even. he did not want
to go because he was not keen on going to strange places alone. he did not want
to leave his group either. workplace insisted that boy goes. he also worried
that this will worsen his relationship with girl. however girl assured boy that
3 months is not so much time, they will be fine as a long distance couple, the
job is probably worth it in the long run. boy reluctantly agreed to the
training. he packed up, said his goodbye, hopped on a plane and flew away.
workplace arranged a private hotel room for accommodation. although around this
time internet was already ubiquitous but not smartphones, the time difference
between his new place and his old place was quite a lot so synchronous
communication methods like instant messaging and videochats were not convenient.
he relied on emails for communication. he started one thread with girl and one
thread with flatmate. his work training was quite boring and boy was not
interested in sightseeing either. outside work he just spent his time alone in
the hotel room. he did not have much to say to girl. the email exchanges they
had were quite short and to the point. mostly just status updates and long
distance word hugs. that is how the email thread with flatmate started too.
however in flatmate&apos;s case he had a lot of undisclosed thoughts. now that boy
was far away and the fact he had started working professionally, started his
adult life, he thought maybe he has not much to lose. at worst he could just not
go home at all. he wanted to dump all his thoughts on unsuspecting flatmate in
email. boy found the email medium much easier to deal with. he can slowly think
through what he wants, write it down and then just press a button when he is
ready. things he would not have guts to say in person was now possible to
communicate through email. this was his fantasy after all. to completely open up
to another person. boy wrote an email and sent it. he messed it up.
</p>

<p>
boy did not thought his emotions and thoughts through. he dumped them on
flatmate in raw, undigested form. flatmate had no chance making sense of them.
he made flatmate deal with his feelings. she was angry at boy about this
irresponsible way of communication. she was was fine with boy feeling emotions
and working through them with her but he should take responsibility for them.
she tried explaining this to boy repeatedly but boy did not get the message. in
the emails boy explained that he is attracted to flatmate and would like to be
with her but he also liked what he had with girl. he did not understand what
this feeling was and what should he do now. he was sort of expecting flatmate to
come up with a solution for his dilemma. for him everything, including his
emotions had to have rational explanations. he went on trying to come up with
all sorts of silly rationalizations of his feelings, cost benefit analysis of
the various solutions, all sprinkled with many self depreciation comments. he
presented all this like if flatmate and girl were just pawns in boy&apos;s
calculations for maximizing his life happiness. all this was unfair and
insulting to flatmate. he wrote long walls of nonsensical text and thus made
flatmate angry. eventually boy apologized in his own, nonsensical way of writing
which flatmate accepted after she realized she cannot talk much sense into boy.
they did not talk much about this topic afterwards.
</p>

<p>
the 3 months slowly passed and boy was back in apartment. he did not like
keeping secrets so he explained girl what he did without going into too much
details. girl was not amused but since he did not actually do anything sinful,
she did not get angry, she appreciated the honesty. girl always trusted
flatmate, she knew flatmate was also just a victim to boy&apos;s craziness, she did
not get angry at her either. the relationship between boy and flatmate got a bit
colder but they remained friends. they did not talk about the emails afterwards
as if they wished they never happened.
</p>

<p>
another year passed. boy had a good job. he did not like it very much but he
understood that he would like other places even less. nevertheless boy
interviewed at another prestigious multinational company in a far away, western
country. he did not think much of it at first but he managed to get an offer to
work there. boy heard only good things about this company and the offered salary
was also much higher than his current one. but it also meant leaving behind the
apartment. girl was a little bit reluctant to go too. the prestige, money and
the experience of a foreign country was attractive. boy was leaning on going.
girl asked boy to marry her already and then she will go with him.
</p>

<p>
boy understood girl wanted marriage for a while now. for boy marriage was just a
technicality but he understood it meant a lot for girl. he wanted to have family
with girl so he did not really have objections against it except for one thing.
he felt that he had way too little part of his fantasies fulfilled and with girl
he will not ever be able to fulfill those. he feared that later he might get a
chance or find a way to fulfill some of those fantasies in ways girl would not
fully approve of. he might even want to have sex with others. he was feeling a
big void in his life and he could not bear the idea of locking away the full
human experience forever. he cannot marry girl if he is kept on a leash. girl
was sad to hear this. girl&apos;s heart was limitless though. he heard boy. girl said
he does not want boy unhappy. if he is honest with her, they can work through
this even if it meant boy having his crazy adventures. boy was happy to hear
this and agreed to the marriage. they quickly married privately without any
pompous ceremonies. then they packed up and left for the greener fields.
</p>

<p>
in the new city boy and girl rented a nice two bedroom apartment and the two of
them lived alone. boy was spending most of his time at work, girl was learning
the new language. during evenings and weekends they spent their time at home
watching movies or just generally being lazy since boy continued to show
complete lack of interest in leaving his home. boy was missing their previous
arrangement. he suggested that they should get flatmates again in the hopes
things will get more fun again. they understood that their relationship with
their previous flatmates was very good and it is unlikely that any new roommate
will be the same. the previous flatmates were not picked randomly, they knew
them well, girl even lived with one of them for a while. they wanted the new,
stranger flatmates only for short stays just to be on the safe side. girl was
quite the social butterfly. she quickly managed to build up a small social
network for herself mostly consisting of expats from her country living in their
new city. she could find roommates through her social network, she never needed
to formally advertise the free room. their new apartment was more modern. each
bedroom had its own bathroom and shower room and the bedrooms connected to the
living room directly. no longer was the case that people had to go through each
other&apos;s private room multiple times per day. each person could have its own
undisturbed privacy if they wanted to.
</p>

<p>
many years passed. boy and girl lived more or less happily. they had many short
term flatmates, men, women, couples. for boy none of them felt like what he
before. he socialized very little with any of the new flatmates. boy spent most
of his time in the living room where he installed his computer. a lot of the
flatmates spent their time in their private room. boy had very little contact
with them. he could not really connect with anyone. it turned out that there
were more benefits for boy in their previous arrangement than boy initially
suspected. in the old apartment the door between the two bedrooms was always
open. anybody could enter the other room any time and they even had to do so
occasionally just to move around in the house. everyone trusted each other so
well that this was not a problem. if someone needed more privacy, they went into
the bathroom. boy and girl had a curtain around their bed. though boy did not
really care, girl felt comfortable like that, especially during sexy times. the
other magical part was that each bedroom had two inhabitants who talked a lot
with each other. boy and girl heard what flatmate and sister are talking and
vice versa. as boy listened in on these conversations, he learned a lot about
each person&apos;s personalities without actually having to participate. he could
even tune out any time without repercussions in case he did not feel like
listening to others. through this boy felt more connected to his flatmates and
as such he felt it easier to have small talk with them later on. with the
constant back and forth walking through the apartment he was even forced to have
the occasional small chat. this tremendously improved boy&apos;s social skills. all
this was unavailable in his new environment. he could not connect with the new
flatmates. nevertheless boy still wanted to keep trying new flatmates.
</p>

<p>
boy was not happy. to escape his sadness he doubled down on his porn. his porn
continued to be softcore. all he cared is looking casual nudity and imagining
himself in situations where he can share his casual nudity with others and be
accepted like he is. whenever nobody was at home, he was looking at porn and
masturbating. he masturbated a lot. like most addictive behaviors, it did not
help. he became sadder and just masturbated more. he did not think much of this
at first. as the addiction spiraled and as he was spending all his time on
masturbation he started to get more introspective. maybe all this sadness of his
is due to porn. he never really liked the fact that he is masturbating. he tried
to wean himself off of it in the past but he never succeeded. he decided to quit
it for real this time. it was hard. he had many false starts. eventually he
succeeded. he managed to wean off porn and stay free of it for almost a year. he
did not even masturbate, all he had is the sex with girl. boy&apos;s mood recovered.
during that time he was not depressed anymore but he still felt a void in his
life. he still felt that he needs more to be fully happy. eventually he did not
see much benefit of being fully off porn, so he started looking at it
occasionally again. however he learned to have self control. he consumed it
rarely and he appreciated it like an expensive fine wine.
</p>

<p>
time passed. a new flatmate was coming. it was girl&apos;s childhood bestie. she was
coming for a few months to study language. boy was looking forward to this new
roommate because he already knew her. girl forced boy to meet her a long time
ago. boy knew that bestie is quite a friendly and easygoing person. maybe he can
connect a little bit better with her. bestie started living them. girl and
bestie talked a lot with each other. passively listening to these conservations
helped boy get to know bestie. she spent a lot of time in the living room, or
when she went to her bedroom to study, she left her door open. boy had a lot of
chances to practice small talk which he did. he got comfortable around bestie.
</p>

<p>
it was summer. summers in the new country were quite cold, people were not
really sweating. boy&apos;s living room had large windows instead of walls. when sun
shined, it could get quite hot nevertheless. to compensate boy tried to wear as
little clothes as allowed. when alone or only in girl&apos;s presence he was often
completely nude. he liked being nude because he did not want to hide himself. on
the contrary, he wanted to show off himself so that the world accepts him as he
is even if it meant sometimes feeling a bit cold. boy was comfortable around
bestie so he told her he likes to be nude. he then asked if he can be nude
around. bestie said she does not mind nudity but maybe he should not. girl said
the same thing. this time had the courage to understand this as a yes. he
thought they might be uncomfortable with this but they will survive if he does
this. this was big step for boy. this meant bestie would be the second trusted
person on earth to whom he could show himself fully naked. he always wanted to
do this even with others but this was the first time he gained enough courage
over time to actually act on his desires. before this time he was also concerned
about his circumcision. by this time he learned that it was not a big deal. in
fact, it made him wanted to show his penis even more. accepting his imperfect
body would have meant even greater respect than accepting a perfect one. boy
started out hanging out nude in front of his computer. one day he acquired the
courage to walk to the kitchen nude for a glass of water in front of bestie.
bestie was very casual about it. she did not even flinch, mind or even give him
much attention. boy started walking around naked even more. bestie continued to
act casually. girl was a little bit uncomfortable with this but she let boy live
his fantasy out. this was exciting for boy. there he was, naked, and people
accepting him. sometimes it was a little bit too exciting him. in those cases he
had to go back to his computer corner and wait a bit to cool down. he wanted to
show off his erection too so people accept his even more private and shameful
aroused state too. that would mean even deeper acceptance. however he was not
comfortable with that yet. although it was exciting for boy to be naked in
bestie&apos;s presence, bestie never acknowledged him the way boy wanted. she never
visibly looked at his penis, she never made any comments or questions about his
penis. boy wanted to know if bestie noticed his circumcision and if she accepts
him even like that. boy did not push the conversation further since bestie had a
fiancé at home. he did not want to create any drama due to misunderstandings.
one afternoon bestie had a terrible headache. boy offered a back massage. bestie
gladly accepted, she loved massages. she lied down on the sofa, took off her
shirt and bra in a private manner so boy had an access to bestie&apos;s fully exposed
back. boy knew that if he is nude he would not be able to go through this
without an erection so he put his underwear back on before working on bestie.
all this happened in girl&apos;s presence so boy did not feel dirty doing this. boy
massaged until girl finished cooking their dinner, about 15 minutes. afterwards
bestie said she quite liked the massage, boy had good hands. as time went on,
boy was getting more and more comfortable around her. however bestie&apos;s planned
return slowly approached. boy continued to hang out nude to get his fantasy fix
until bestie leaves. the time came. bestie packed up, said her goodbye and left
without ever acknowledging boy&apos;s penis. boy and girl was alone again.
</p>

<p>
boy was a bit happier than before. he had the chance to physically open up to
another person. however this time he missed the emotional openness. boy remained
unsatisfied. one experience remained in his mind. bestie complimented him on the
massage. he was wondering that if he could massage people he might have more
chance to fulfill his fantasies. he wanted to see flatmate&apos;s and bestie&apos;s naked
bodies. he never had the chance. he did not only want a glance, he wanted to
study them, really immerse himself in their bodies not sexually but with
curiosity. he thought that through massage he could study other bodies and maybe
connect with others. he talked through this with girl who liked the idea of boy
learning massage and even found a nice class for him to learn relaxation
massage. boy signed up and started attending the sessions. it was different from
what boy expected. about a dozen of people attended the class and most were
women. there was only one other man. first half of each session was a classroom
study of anatomy. the instructor talked through a slideshow while the students
made notes. she was teaching muscles, bones, skin structure, various diseases,
indications and contraindications of massage. the second half was more exciting
since it was about practicing the massage on each other. this is what boy was
excited about. the excitement flattened when he learned how the instructor
massaged. she always told the clients to keep the pants and bras on, she only
did back and legs, she avoided massaging the chest and stomach area because
that&apos;s more sexual to her than relaxing, and she draped aggressively. the
students had to follow her teaching. when some girls went to the changing room
to dress off and took their bras off so that people do not need to fuss around
with their bras, the instructor asked them to put them back on. this way the
sessions were quite boring for boy. there was not the slightest chance that he
will see anything exciting. he liked the touch, he just did not find the
intimacy he was looking for. the massage course consisted of 8 sessions, one
session every other saturday. one of the requirements for the massage
certificate was to do case studies. he needed to find clients, massage them and
then write a report about the session. since he did not know anybody, he asked
girl to arrange clients from her social circle. she did so. boy did not want to
stray off the protocol, he did the massage the way he was taught. clients kept
the underwear on and boy draped them well. he did not mind doing the massages
but he did not get his fix from it. he did not know most of his clients either.
boy was not good at small talk so he let girl talk with them before and after
the massage, boy just did the massaging. boy never asked anything in exchange.
he did them for free with the story that he needs them for his case studies.
clients reported that they liked the massage. he even had a handful of repeat
clients. it was hard for boy to justify why clients should come again. he had
his case study about them the first time they came. if they were to come again,
there was no easy way for clients to feel that they paid for the service. boy
did not want to ask for money because seeing and touching bodies was all the
payment he needed.
</p>

<p>
there was one lady who really liked the massage. she came back many times. boy
did not want money so she usually brought cookies. one day boy suggested that he
wants to do stomach side as well. lady did not object so boy started massaging
that part too. boy also came up with the idea that a massage should cover the
buttock area too since there are many muscle endings there. lady did not object
to that either. whenever boy was massaging the back, he also pushed down the
pants a bit so that he better access that part of her body. one day her adult
daughter came for a massage too since she was curious to see what this massage
was like given her mother went to boy so often. both lady and daughter had
attended some massage courses in their past but neither of them was actively
massaging. after the massage daughter gave some tips to boy how to improve his
game. she showed him improved draping techniques and she suggested that boy
could massage the whole chest area too, even for ladies since that is how she
learned. boy really liked this tip. boy hoped that daughter will return so that
he can practice on him. she never did but lady did. boy told what daughter said
and lady did not object. he told lady she might as well be naked, boy will drape
her well. lady was naked under the sheets. boy was happy. an exposed lady was
under her hands, covered by the sheets, trusting boy that he will not abuse his
position. boy did everything the way he learnt. he followed the draping
technique meticulously, lady was never exposed. when boy got to chest area, he
uncovered lady, fully exposing her bare chest. boy was even happier. there was
lady in front of him with even more trust in him. boy massaged the chest but
avoided the breast area because he was not sure he can touch that area or not.
when the massage was over, the magic ended. he covered her up and left the room.
lady reported that she enjoyed the massage. she came back many times afterwards.
boy enjoyed working on her. boy wanted a bit more so he tried pushing his luck.
he asked if he could use looser draping in her crotch area in the private hopes
that he can catch a glimpse of her private area. to boy&apos;s dismay lady said she
preferred the ordinary draping. boy continued doing the same massage the same
way and lady continued coming back for a while. then the frequency of visits
started dropping, eventually she stopped coming. in the early sessions when lady
was still a bit uncomfortable about what is expected in return, boy suggested
that she does the massage she learned on him. lady said it was long time passed
since she done it last time but she agreed. when the time came, she said that
this massage is done naked. boy was happy to hear that. he was expecting that he
can fully expose himself to someone. she draped well so boy did not had the
chance to show his penis off. boy liked the massage nevertheless. she did a
quite involved massage, requiring a lot of strength, boy understood why she
stopped doing it. boy was doing his massage on the floor but lady&apos;s massage
required a massage table which was a bit involved to transport over. a while
later boy asked for this massage again but lady refused, she really did not want
to do these massages so she kept just bringing cookies.
</p>

<p>
time passed. boy kept thinking about satisfying his curiosity. one thing that he
remembered sometimes is his experience with friend. he liked the trust he had
there. boy realized since he is not really looking for sex, he does not
necessarily need women to have deep connections with. he expanded what he is
looking for. he found a male nude yoga group. it sounded weird but it might
worth a shot, he thought. he signed up for a class and went there. there were
dozen of other guys. everybody disrobed, so did boy. he liked the feeling of
being nude in front of others. he took a quick glances at other people but he
did not feel comfortable staring so he did not. the yoga itself was in a
darkened room, the exercises were quite rapid, so he did not spend a lot of time
staring at others, nor did others visibly stare him. after the exercises there
was a communal shower. there were two shower rooms. one fit three people, the
other only two. boy was one of the last people showering in the two people room.
the thought of boy was showering fully exposed in the presence of another person
was somewhat exciting for boy. he got a anxious that he might get an erection
and how embarrassing that would be. to be safe, he quickly finished his shower,
left the shower room, dressed up and went home. he did like the experience but
it was not as satisfying as he expected. he did not connect with other people.
for that he needs to repeatedly expose himself to the experience. however the
group is quite far away from his place, quite late, and requires payment, all
giving an obstacle for boy. he never went again. not because he did not want to
but rather it required way more effort and planning than he was comfortable
with.
</p>

<p>
time passed again. there was not much excitement in boy&apos;s life. over time he
thought of many ideas but he never really acted on any of them. he always had
some excuses. he thought of going to a nudist beach. his problem with this was
the same as with the naked yoga. he did not really like the idea of going to
beach on its own. he could not even recall when was he last time on any beach.
passively staring at nude people would not give boy his fix. it might make him
even more annoyed having everyone exposed, yet not being able to connect with
people due to his social anxieties and general lack of ability to talk with
people. he would need to repeatedly go before he finds the right set of people
he can connect and hang out with naked. repeatedly going to a nude beach was
infeasible for him because he lived in a cold and very religious country that
did not have public nudist groups. he did not want to go alone either. girl did
not really like the idea of going to nudist beaches. she was not opposed to
clothing optional resorts but she preferred not to if she had a chance. boy
never pushed this idea further. boy also thought of using escort services. even
with girl&apos;s approval, he could not do it. he does not like going to a stranger&apos;s
place, paying large sums of money for connection. he would not feel it genuine.
the temporary connection he would get would be over after the session. boy wants
a lasting connection. a friend with who he could talk for hours, maybe through
email. he then thought of finding email penpals. he found a few people on online
forums with whom he started talking. he started threads with more people but
only a few of them had a style and content resonating with boy. he slowly opened
up with those and started sharing very personal thoughts. as the length of the
letters grew, the email threads he had slowly died off. he did not want to push
others to keep the discussion since he did not even know who the others were.
although he did not talk about it, boy wanted to know the people in real life
even if he only talked to them through emails. he wanted to be sure that in case
he fully opened to the other person emotionally, he had the chance to open up
physically. for boy talking with distant strangers on the internet meant that
there was a very little chance for the latter. he thought of using dating sites
instead. he did sign up for a free site in the past but the fact that he had to
start discussions was quite daunting for him. he never felt comfortable
initiating. he always closed his accounts after long periods of inactivity.
</p>

<p>
time passed again. boy and girl started approaching their thirties. girl wanted
children. boy was not that keen on the idea since that meant giving up a lot of
his freedom. he feared the amount of time and effort the child will need. he
feared the chance of having a high attention child. girl insisted. nevertheless
boy wanted to keep girl happy. boy agreed to the idea of children and a year
later they had their son. boy wanted to avoid being a bad father. he wanted to
ensure when he is at home, he never ignored son. son turned out requiring a lot
of attention. boy had to hold and carry son a lot to calm son down, to stop him
from crying. boy was happy to do that. he started spending less time on his
computer. he did not mind that, since he was mindlessly consuming the internet
most of the time anyways. when the initial shock of the new baby subsided, boy&apos;s
desire for more connection and sexuality in his life was back on his mind.

<h2 id="blogging">blogging</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>people should blog!</p>
<p>
i guess almost all bloggers write a meta post about blogging where they either
explain why they blog or why others should be blogging. well, better not to
stick out of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
sometimes a thought or idea gets into my mind and unless i talk or write about
it, it keeps pestering me. writing about my thoughts really helps me organize
them a little bit. it calms my mind. having them outside my brain means that i
do not need to worry about losing a thought so i can calmly forget about it. it
is important to have an audience though. without it i would not be motivated to
keep the sentences even remotely coherent. it forces me to think really hard on
how to express some of these pesky thoughts in somewhat sane way. but often i do
not really have an audience. or even if i did have one the thought is so long
that it would be rude to send someone an unsolicited wall of text. so i thought
i write to an imaginary audience, in a somewhat secret place on the internet
that nobody reads. the possibility that someone will read this forces me to
write in a somewhat clear way.
</p>

<p>
most of the stuff i write is just crappy ideas or silly thoughts. better out
than in as the saying goes, no need to take my writing seriously. i do not think
that on my deathbed i will be agonizing over the fact that i was stupid on the
internet. more likely scenario is that i did not dump everything from my brain,
i still feel like there is some unfinished business i have to do. dumping
everything here helps me achieve my little nirvana sooner. now all i need to do
is to gather the courage and start writing. i have more than enough silliness to
write about, i just get overly anxious what my non-existent audience will think
of me. not forcing myself to reserve time for this is not helping either.
</p>

<p>
so that is about me. why should others blog? i do not follow many blogs but i
would be super interested in reading blogs of some of the people around me i
personally know. i am very reluctant to initiate towards people but i could
learn more about the person through their words. i could learn how they think,
what do they think about the world, what do they do in general and so on. i will
see a personality behind the face. i am not interested in reshares or likes
though. that is very low quality signal about the person. i really wish for
short article format, not twitter sized thought bites. if people want to point
to an article, i would much prefer if they would rewrite articles in their own
words rather than linking to an existing article saying &quot;hey follower, read
this&quot;. there are a lot of rotten links on the internet so such posts consisting
only of a link would be worthless after a while. the blogger&apos;s personality will
flow into the rewrite so even if something is not an original idea, i will still
see the issue from the blogger&apos;s point of view. it also demonstrates that the
blogger actually read the article not just blindly resharing something they have
seen on the internet.
</p>

<p>
i also prefer if bloggers did not have any tracking, commenting or other
popularity counting widgets on their blog. this is why it is better to run one&apos;s
own blog rather than relying on shared services like facebook and whatnot where
one cannot even turn off these features. the problem is that if the blog starts
to get popular the blogger will start to care about popularity. they will be
more likely to write posts that get the most attention rather than what they
actually think. they will either moderate themselves, become less radical, more
mainstream, more boring or they will swing into the opposite direction where
they will get super radical and all their posts will be about outrage. if one
does not have any analytics at all, they are less likely to fall into this trap.
</p>

<p>
a comment about publicly visible comments: it is very easy to get demotivated or
get argumentative when posting very controversial or unpopular thoughts and then
reading the comments. i think it is easier to open up if one does not need to
spend rest of their energy on arguing with others after posting something
personal. if a post generates significant response then i would rather see a
followup post summarizing the private response than wade through all the
comments. this really helps to keep the content of the blog linear. it should be
possible to read a blog just like a book. i think it is best to keep discussions
on sites that are specialized for this and as such have moderation and other
means of maintaining civility.
</p>

<h2 id="space">space</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>weird fantasies about owning a big empty space in a city.</p>
<p>
i like to daydream about stuff i would do in particular situations. that does
not mean that actually want to do said stuff though. i just want to play with
the thought. today&apos;s topic is what would i do if i owned a big, enclosed,
private, empty space in the middle of a city? something like a 20 person
conference room. an apartment with a huge living room but no kitchen or
bedrooms. this would be at a different place from what i call home. i could rent
it, sure. but that is boring. what would i do if i had to make use of it myself?
what events would i organize in it?
</p>

<p>
there are many crazy ideas to choose from! the first idea that pops into my mind
is to create a place for videogame lan parties. i do not like the modern,
isolating online gameplay but lan parties can be pretty fun because you know the
people you frag, you can see their face when you frag them. i could even install
a projector and play crew or bridge simulators like artemis. but maybe i would
restrict the games we can play to the ones that run on a raspberry pi. all the
gaming machines would be only raspberry pi machines. i guess not many people
would be interested in playing but the ones that would be interested are
probably somewhat similarly crazy as me so i would find it more fun this way.
</p>

<p>
it would be also fun to build something together with a small team (also only
working on raspberry pies just for the sake of it). we could gather every now
and then and build random game or website in a hackathlon style. the projects
could be about reimplementing modern tools and games to be super efficient so
that they are so fast that you could use them on a raspberry pies.
</p>

<p>
hmm, let me go full crazy mode while at this. as i hinted in a previous post i
have some issues around sexual expression, intimacy and so on. although i keep
searching for it, i cannot find events in this area that would spike my
interest. maybe i could start organizing events in this space. i have bunch of
ideas. i do not necessarily like them all the same but i would totally try some
of them.
</p>

<p>
my first idea would be to create a nude gym. is it not the case that the ancient
greeks used to train and compete completely nude? there is some sort of magic to
this. in my fantasy these events have a relatively stable set of people rather
than different set of strangers showing up in every session. i think nudity
boosts the intimacy between people which deepens friendships and respect between
ourselves. being in a friendly and respectful environment can be very motivating
in achieving our goals. also i just like to look at naked bodies, especially if
they are well and fit. if the cost of this is that i have to train next to them
then i think that is a cost i can gladly pay. by myself i have zero motivation
to do any physical exercises.
</p>

<p>
my next crazy idea is a &quot;grooming exchange&quot;. i like to be clean and shaved most
of the time. but shaving is such a boring activity. what if i had to shave other
people and other people would shave me? i do not have problems with seeing or
touching bare bodies. i think doing such things together would be quite fun.
people can chat and bond while shaving or whatever special grooming the other
person requires. and i would even feel some sense of accomplishment that i
managed to make someone else&apos;s life a little bit easier.
</p>

<p>
i feel that there is a lot of shame in people around their bodies. they feel
that it is something to be ashamed of, something to hide. i think that is
nonsense and in fact i swing way too much into the other direction: the bodies
should be actively shared and exhibited. so my next idea is about trying to
reduce the shame around nudity and help with the body acceptance. this would be
a group activity. each participant goes in front of the group and completely
disrobes. then each audience member describes the person&apos;s body in a very
neutral and objective manner. the point of the exercise is to disassociate
ourselves with our body features and body flaws. it does not matter how our body
looks like. having others objectify our body helps us treat our body as a tool
to for achieving our goals rather than an end in itself. hmm. i am not entirely
sure about this one. it might be a useless exercise. but i think it would be
still interesting to give this idea a try.
</p>

<p>
or how about a masturbation club? it is pretty clear to me that there is a lot
of private masturbation going on in a lot of folks lives. but why does this have
to be such a private thing? what is it about it that makes it so disgusting that
we do not do it together? i think once we accept our bodies, our feelings and
the fact that we are not all that different from each other, this activity can
become an okay thing to do together. sure, the first few sessions would be
totally weird but once the initial shock wears off, it becomes a normal thing.
there are several ways to do this, i think it really depends on the folks
involved how they want to do it. the participants just can sit in a circle and
have a go at it. maybe they want to watch some videos on a phone or laptop
during session, that is okay. maybe they just want to watch others, that is okay
too. the other benefit of doing this regularly is that this can defuse the
obsessiveness of this act. one of the reasons for all the uncontrolled
masturbation is that sexual gratification is pretty much random: you might or
might not get some gratification based on other people&apos;s mood and your luck.
masturbation is just a coping mechanism against this randomness. i think if i
can get gratification regularly, the need for the constant gratification
disappears. if i can get myself to masturbate only with others, i cannot go
overboard with it since i would be limited to doing it only during the
encounters.
</p>

<p>
there is this thing called orgasmic meditation. i do not actually know much
about it so let me reinvent it from scratch. this activity is done in pairs. one
person lies down on the floor and the other person is stroking or otherwise
stimulating the first person&apos;s genitals in a very simplistic manner for a long
time without any changes in the stimulation pattern. i quite like this picture.
the stimulator&apos;s job is very simple: just keep doing what they are doing. there
is no performance expectation. the person on the floor can relax, daydream.
orgasm is not the point here. i can compare this against a massage. for instance
an ordinary back massage can get boring after a while, especially if it is the
same movement over and over again. massage requires constant adjustments,
changes in stimulation and so on so it is hard to get fully relax into it. and
even if one relaxes into it, they might fall asleep which somewhat suggests that
it was boring. but i can imagine it is somewhat different with genitals: in
general i think genital stimulation takes much much longer time to get to the
boring stage. more importantly genital stimulation sort of turns on one&apos;s mind
(it fills it with sexual thoughts) so they will not simply phase out but can
actually consciously enjoy the quiet time. i think doing this in a group is
beneficial because then because the people can swap partners all the time so the
novelty factor keeps people interested in the activity.
</p>

<p>
now let me fantasize about more sexually explicit activities. i do not have much
sexual experience outside my primary relationship but i am not particularly
seeking such activity either. that is mostly because of a combination of me
being lazy and shy. however i do yearn for some extra experience. so i am
thinking of a &quot;guided sexual encounter&quot;. this would be ideal for super shy,
non-communicative and submissive people like myself. in this activity you bring
or are matched with a sexual partner. each person writes some preferences,
no-nos and other notes onto a slice of paper and gives it to the guide. the
guide reads the preferences, thinks of a scenario and starts suggesting actions
to do for the participants. all the participants have to do is just simply
follow the instructions. instructions could be something along the lines of
touch here, massage that part, stroke faster and so on. there is no performance
anxiety since the participants can project that onto the guide. this activity
does not really require a group unless the activity guided is a group sex
itself. but still, i suspect doing stuff together, even if it is silly stuff,
can be a great fun.
</p>

<p>
in fact i could go further with this &quot;guided sexual encounter&quot; thing. how about
something like a drama or acting club? there would be a script where all members
have a role to play and they have to act out the story. i am envisioning acting
out favourite sex or porn scenes (mild ones that contain more interaction rather
than sex). the nice thing is that this allows anxious people acquire sexual
experiences in a very controlled manner. since there is a script, everyone knows
what will happen, there will not be surprises. one can mentally prepare well
ahead for the event. i am not fully sure how fun this would be or if there are
even scripts that make sense but i think there is some potential in this and
would be fun to explore it a bit.
</p>

<p>
and the most explicit fantasy is just having a sex club. i am not thinking of a
free for all group sex here but something more akin to the masturbation club.
couples or groups would come and just have their sex next to the other couples
or groups. or people can join just to watch and masturbate. at this stage this
might be a little bit intimidating even for me. but it does not sound a boring
activity.
</p>

<p>
so those would be the activities i would be thinking of organizing. couple of
notes. first, i would totally ban any food and drink consumption in this place.
food and drinks create a lot of waste, it is just simply less maintenance this
way. and besides, food and drinks is often just a passive, pure consumption
activity and i would rather avoid having such activities take place there. i
would especially prohibit alcohol and other drugs in this place. primarily
because i do not like alcohol, secondly i think it is healthier if we can blast
through our insecurities without the help of drugs. drugs can alter people&apos;s
personality, make them less controllable which is something i do not want to
deal with at my place either.
</p>

<p>
there is also a problem of where would i find people interested in such
activities. from all i can see is that most people find sex, nudity and intimacy
with strangers disgusting to even talk about. my craziest idea about this is to
create a special social network for this if one does not already exist. anyone
can join the network but in order to establish a connection with another person
(&quot;become friends&quot;) both people need to: a) have seen the other person&apos;s genitals
in person, and b) know what the other person&apos;s sexual fantasies are. the goal
for the individuals in the network would be to gather as many friends as
possible. i ask only for genitals rather than full nudity because the latter can
be hard to arrange while the former can be done in a form of a flash almost
anywhere. so people meaning to become friends can have a date, talk about sex,
flash to each other and then become friends on the network. what i want to
encourage in this network to make sexuality a normal thing to talk about. when
sex is a normal topic, people would be more comfortable telling what they like,
where their boundaries are, ask for advice and so on. i do not like the fact
that this topic feels very taboo in our society. i think being part of such a
community would then make it easier for me to find like minded people. by &quot;like
minded people&quot; i mean people who do not take life way too seriously, who are
non-monogamous, non-judging, open sexually and so on.
</p>

<p>
but obviously i am way too lazy to set up something like that. actually i would
much prefer if such clubs existed somewhere else where i could just go. although
i suspect i would be way too anxious to go to such place anyways. maybe when i
am old and retired, i might set up a club like this for the new generation. all
this remains a daydream for now.
</p>

<h2 id="timestamping">timestamping</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>i don't timestamp my posts.</p>
<p>
i am somewhat on the fence with regards adding timestamps to my posts. i want my
posts to contain only the content and nothing else. i want my posts to stand on
their own with no regards to posting time. when i wrote a post is usually
irrelevant anyways. on the other hand it is nice to see a rough indication of
the age of the post. hah, this reminds me of some weirdness i used to see on
some blogger.com sites. the posts and comments would have a timestamp in the
month, day, hour:minute:second format. awesome. a timestamp accurate to the
second. the only part missing? the year. because obviously that was not as
important as the seconds. i actually seen this in a lot of such blogs. super
weird. fortunately i have not encountered this recently so i am assuming this
got fixed or i managed to avoid blogger.com blogs.
</p>

<p>
anyways, this leads me to the idea that perhaps just stamping the posts with the
year they were written would be useful. i write only a couple posts per year so
i think the year granularity is more than enough. but still, i do not want to
put this metadata spam into my post contents. i have decided to just put it onto
the /frontpage. so instead of:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /post3 baz
</li><li>
  /post2 bar
</li><li>
  /post1 foo
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i would have this:
</p>

<p>
2019 entries:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /post3 baz
</li>
</ul>

<p>
2018 entries:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /post2 bar
</li><li>
  /post1 foo
</li>
</ul>

<p>
looks a bit ugly but it does the job so i will go with it for now.
</p>

<h2 id="binding">binding</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>keeping books open is hard.</p>
<p>
i really like reading books. i do not do it often though. it mostly happens in
batches where i read many books over a few days when i have a few days of
calmness available around me. these days i usually read on kindle. it is very
convenient, light and there is the benefit that i do not need to physically
store the books. i do not like the idea of having a bookcase of the all the
books i ever read: it takes space, maintenance (ugh, i hate cleaning) and i do
not really want others see what i read. having said all that i do occassionally
run across a physical book. usually someone loans one to me, or i just pick one
up randomly when i am at a place which has books and i have time. my problem is
that the book usability is quite bad due to the way the pages are bound
together!
</p>

<p>
for instance i cannot just open the typical book in the middle and put it onto
the desk and read it from there. it would just close itself like a spring. i
have to keep holding the pages to keep the book from closing. if i want to hold
the book in air, i often need two hands. for one hand holding, i have to roll
over one side of the book. reading the rolled side is quite annoying if even
possible. it is also very easy to break the binding. once i do that, the book
becomes more brittle, the individual papers might fall out much easier. also i
have to hold the book slightly differently depending i am reading the beginning,
the middle or the end of it.
</p>

<p>
what annoys me the most is that all those problems go away with coil or spiral
binding. one downside i can think of is that maybe books do not stack well if
bound that way. that is however not a problem for me because i do not care about
how nice a books look when stacked but about its content and ease of consuming
that content. all my notebooks are coil bound and they are convenient to use.
why is it then that most modern books are still bound with that annoying method?
i tried searching the web for an explanation and i could not find any. my only
guess is that people are so used to this horribleness that they do not even
realize things could be better. this is so annoying that if i wanted a printed
version of a book, i would try to get the ebook version, print that and coil
bind it myself. why is this so hard to do in the printing press in the first
place?
</p>

<p>
the other downside i can think of is that this way it might be harder to search
for a specific book in a bookcase since the book might not have a side with a
title on it. i am not convinced that this is a problem though. i am pretty sure
you could slide a long piece of cardboard or a plastic marker into the coil that
contains the title when you look at it from side. think of this like sliding a
pen into the coil and clipping it to it. when reading the book you pull this
marker out. whenever you finished a reading session you slide the marker back
and put the book back onto the bookcase. you can easily clip other random stuff
to the coil.
</p>

<p>
and more importantly there is no need to &quot;close&quot; the book. no need for bookmarks
or remembering page numbers. next time you pick up the book, you can start
reading where you left off. in fact all this is pretty awesome! i should totally
start my own book printing business.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  edit from 2021: i&apos;ve posted this to r/changemyview.
</p>

<p>
since after 2 years i was still holding this view,
i decided to ask reddit about it at
https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o0z5jj/cmv_books_should_be_wirebound/.
</p>

<p>
here are the common counterarguments:
</p>

<ul><li>
  can&apos;t stack: hoarding such books would be hard for collectors and bookstores.
  while this is true,
  i&apos;m not sure why i should inconvenience my reading experience for this.
  apparently people don&apos;t buy books to read but to show them off.
  i&apos;m not the target audience for most books.
</li><li>
  lacks durability: if you heavily use a book,
  wirebound books are more likely to break.
  this is probably true too.
  but still, it&apos;s not that convincing for me
  while i live in a world full of planned obsolescence. :(
</li><li>
  is costly: to counteract the durability problem,
  higher quality paper will be needed.
  and the lack of established mass production for such books also makes it costlier.
  true... but it&apos;s unclear how much costlier it would be.
</li><li>
  use an ebook reader: if my only problem is inconvenience,
  maybe i just need a good quality ebook reader.
  yeah, this is also true and is pretty much what i do.
  ebook readers also explain to me why others aren&apos;t complaining about books.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it was a nice discussion.
i learned some nuance from it
but didn&apos;t really make like ordinarily bound books better.
if anything, it made me like my kindle more.
</p>

<h2 id="typeshooter">typeshooter</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a silly typing fps game idea.</p>
<p>
there is this old rail shooter called &quot;the house of the dead&quot;. it is about
shooting zombies, the game takes care of moving. there is a mod to it called
&quot;the typing of the dead&quot; where the player has a keyboard instead of a gun and
has to eliminate the zombies via writing the words or sentences above the
zombies&apos; head. it sounds quite silly but it is a super fun game. just look up a
gameplay video about it to get the idea.
</p>

<p>
unfortunately there are not many typing games like that. i wonder what would i
create if i had infinite time, willpower, patience, and resources. first i would
totally create a real life version of the game. the player would need to stand
on a roomba-like moving platform. whenever the player clears an area, the roomba
would start moving to the next area. this way the game stays a rail shooter. the
zombies would also have their own roombas that would be moving towards the
player&apos;s roomba and the player has to eliminate the zombies standing on them
before they reach the player&apos;s roomba. instead of a gun, the player would have a
keyboard on themselves just like in the games and each zombie would contain a
magical killphrase that kills them when the player types it. the player&apos;s roomba
would be big enough to hold two people so even the coop part could be recreated.
this should totally exist! for extra difficulty and realism myopic people could
take off their glasses and see if they can beat the game that way!
</p>

<p>
i also wonder if one could create a competitive videogame out of this. take an
ordinary fps like quake3, would it be possible to create a typing game out of
it? in typing of the dead there is no need for movement, it is only about
typing. a game like quake3 would not be a quake game without movement and guns.
i would retain those elements. in my game idea you can freely move around. on
top of the &quot;keyboard&quot; you even have two guns that you can attack with. you
cannot kill with the guns. to kill you need to equip the keyboard and type the
enemy&apos;s killphrase where the enemy is just another player. both guns have
limited ammo but they slowly recharge over time so there is no need to pick up
ammo and such. the first gun is a shotgun and you can use this to push enemies
away so that they do not get close and or to unequip the keyboard of the enemy.
on a shotgun pellet hit the game would force a switch away from the keyboard so
that the enemy needs to start typing from the beginning again. use this gun to
create distance or to keep the enemy from typing. the other gun is a projectile
weapon. when you hit the enemy with the projectile, the game reveals their
killphrase to you. now your goal is to equip the keyboard and type it. there are
several strategies: you try to escape and gain large enough gap from them so
that they cannot attack you while you type their killphrase. strategy b is to
give up your passphrase them (allow them to shoot you) and let them start typing
your killphrase. once they start, you start typing too and you just beat them at
typing. strategy c is to get very close to them and shotgun blast them. i would
make the shotgun super effective at very close range. this would push them very
far away, allowing you to gain enough time to type their killphrase but also
very risky since they could easily hit you with the projectile from such a short
range. maybe other strategies would emerge through gameplay. note that every
enemy sees a different killphrase for you so they cannot just shout it out in
real life and have someone else kill you. also if you kill your enemy, they will
get a different killphrase for you upon respawn.
</p>

<p>
is this fun? i am not sure but i would definitely try a round. and it is
probably would not even hard to implement it as a quake3 mod. keep the shotgun
and rocket launchers and reuse them as describe above. as for the &quot;keyboard gun&quot;
i could use the built in chat mechanism. the engine would watch the messages and
if a valid killphrase appears, it kills the associated player if the killer had
the keyboard gun equipped. the fact that quake3 does not let you change weapon
while chatting is a feature in this case. upon a shotgun hit i can make the mod
switch back your weapon to the primary gun so you will need to quit typing,
change to the keyboard and start typing again. once you learn a killphrase, i
would always show it on your screen so you can mentally prepare to type them on
any given moment.
</p>

<p>
even this could be reimplemented in real life: put a big barcode on every
player&apos;s head, arms, legs, back, torso. give each player a barcode reader. i
propose barcodes since they can scan pretty fast, work well with noise, and all
you need to do is to scan a line from the other people&apos;s body. if you manage to
get close to the enemy and scan their barcode, then you grab your keyboard and
type the killphrase while hoping that you are faster than the other person.
having different barcodes for different body parts could be used to grant
different scores even. if you kill someone then that person cannot attack until
they go back to a spawnzone, scan the barcode there and enter the killphrase to
respawn. or if it is a round based game then they just leave the arena
completely until the next round. to make it apparent what is the killphrase and
who is alive and who is dead, players would mount a smartphone onto their arms
which would display killphrases and the avatars of the enemy players and mark
dead players with a cross. this way you can easily ignore dead players, they
cannot pretend to be alive and ruin the game. i assume that modern barcode
readers are wireless and can tell the smartphone the scan results so the phone
can immediately display the passphrase upon scanning.
</p>

<p>
it is not only deathmatch that could be played with this. capture the flag would
work too. get to the enemy base, scan the barcode at their base and then head
back and scan the local base&apos;s barcode to get a score. obviously this needs to
be done without a death and only one player can carry the flag at any given
moment.
</p>

<p>
keep in mind that these ideas are quite raw and need a lot of polishing. but i
think they do have a potential. it just needs a lot of playtesting to find the
fun. well, at least i cannot say i have nothing to do when i ever get to my
retirement.

<h2 id="cb">cb</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>an idea for a weird twist on facebook.</p>
<p>
so the other day i was thinking about all these nudity and exhibitionism
fantasies again. i am not sure what to do with this. i have been nude with other
people but there is always something lacking which i cannot really put my finger
on. i have not actually tried this but even if i were to upload pictures about
myself naked, i think i would not feel any satisfaction either or it would be
temporary. i think it is the same with other explicit fantasies as well. even if
one could get some satisfaction, it is usually temporary and then they need to
do something again. i think maybe if one could gamify this whole thing, it would
keep people busy enough to trick them into satisfaction. so i have an idea. and
obviously as a tech person my idea is to use more tech. and it only applies to
this niche section of sexuality, the exhibitonism.
</p>

<p>
a sidenote first: i do not think the nudist lifestyle is an answer to this. for
a nudist being nude is normal. with exhibitionism some of the kick stems from
the fact that this is something forbidden or something that society disapproves
of. there is not much sexual energy in pure nudism. also, one could get easily
banned from most places for flaunting an erection.
</p>

<p>
so exhibitionism is about flaunting yourself in front of others potentially with
some innocent sexual connotations. and i think one gets more kick out of it in
real life than doing it online. however we shall not dismiss the power of
putting oneself online too. there are two problems: where would one find a safe
place for flaunting and what would be the point of flaunting?
</p>

<p>
my idea is to create a gamified social network site just for this! anyone can
register there. the point of the game is to connect with the most people you
can. there is a rule for establishing a connection with another member though:
the two people must upload a picture of them flashing their genitals to each
other. if they have the picture, they can become friends. in other words the
goal of the game is to meet locally with as many people as possible and take
genital pictures together! once they have a connection, they can chat with each
other. as a bonus, all uploaded photos and the member graph would totally public
for an extra kick. i&apos;m thinking of naming this as &quot;crotchbook&quot;. it would be a
pun on facebook since instead of face you use your crotch as your profile
picture.
</p>

<p>
totally crazy idea, right? who would ever play this game? probably not many
people. i would totally think about trying it though in order to help myself to
get rid of any shame that society imposes on us about our bodies and sexuality.
to help me learn to ignore what other people think about me (writing stuff like
this into this blog really helps with that though). to accept my body as it is
and not to be ashamed about it (i already managed to do this though). i just
assume there might be other people like this and as such i want a little corner
on the internet for us.
</p>

<p>
i have seen some dating sites, hookup sites, nudist connection sites but usually
they are very open ended and require a lot of effort to communicate what exactly
you want and then find the right people. crotchbook would be laser focused on:
1. arrange a quick meeting, 2. pull down trousers and underwear, 3. snap a pic,
4. upload, 5. optionally put clothes back on. when the other person approves the
pic, the pic and the connection goes public. 2 and 3 can be done in a secluded
corner of a public place. there is not much place to second guess intentions or
for worrying about what will happen because there is a script and it is very
simple. one does the deed and it is over. it has a beginning and an end. one can
feel some after satisfaction establishing a connection. the connection appearing
publicly is the stimulating feedback one might yearn for.
</p>

<p>
it motivates reclusive people like myself to get out of the house because there
is very little string attached to acquiring a connection. it also helps me build
connections since in order to do this i need to meet with other, new people. as
i explained above, one can only talk to people they already have a connection
to. i would need to reach out to my existing connections in order to arrange
meetups with new people. even this can be motivating in itself: if i arrange a
meeting for someone else i feel like i am useful, that i am providing some value
to someone else. i would probably add a helpful metadata for this though: i
would allow tagging the pictures with &quot;weak tie&quot; vs &quot;strong tie&quot;. one would have
weak ties with people they do not know, they only met for the pic. strong ties
mean that the other party is a friend, they talk and stuff. when browsing
profiles, i could then see who could arrange a meeting with my target person: i
would be looking for a 3rd party that has a strong tie with both me and the
target rather than a weak tie.
</p>

<p>
a social network is worth nothing if there are no people on it. but i think it
would be super easy to seed this site compared to other social networks. this
site is not intended for building relationships or creating perfect profiles. it
is solely about uploading semi-naked group pictures. crypto geeks have their
&quot;key signing parties&quot;, exhibitionists could have their &quot;flashing parties&quot;.
suppose there are several folks interested in the site, all living in the same
city. i could find a small place for them where they could come to, snap a
couple group photos and then upload the pics afterwards. now the network is
seeded in that city and the members can start expanding the network via word of
mouth.
</p>

<p>
and this would be even super cheap to run. i would only allow 1 pic per profile
and 1 pic per connection. i would even aggressively downsize pics in order to
fit like 200kb since hosting high definition pictures is not the goal of the
site. furthermore i would delete all messages after 30 days so that i do not
keep stuff forever. maybe i would even delete pics after 2 years so people do
reconnect now and then. i would even delete profiles after 3 years of inactivity
so that the site is not a ghost town. i think the data for all this would be
peanuts, i could even run it on a free tier of a hosting provider. i should
totally create such a site. or even better: someone should beat me to it so i do
not have to deal with this all. this why i put all my ideas onto my blog but i
do not think anybody would ever bother with my crazy ideas.
</p>

<p>
one more observation: i think i really like this idea because there is a script
in it. i know what the game is about. i wonder if this could be generalized.
have a website that contains all sorts of weird sexual scripts that could be
acted out in a safe place. i am mostly talking about stuff that requires
multiple people since otherwise it would be about dating and hookups for which
there are a lot of sites. i talked about this in previous post but let me recap
some ideas:
</p>

<ul><li>
  nude workouts
</li><li>
  shaving clubs
</li><li>
  shared masturbations
</li><li>
  play something akin to the &quot;naked attraction&quot; tv show
</li><li>
  vanilla sex or orgies
</li><li>
  roleplaying (e.g. take a star trek porn and play it through)
</li><li>
  fetishes (servants, pain, anything)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the website would contain various such activities in which the members can
express interest. if there are physically close members with common interests,
the site would match them. it would also offer a venue for the activity that the
members could pay together in case they do not have one. something like
meetup.com but for sex stuff.
</p>

<p>
maybe there is such a website but i did not find anything like that. i think
there would be a dime a dozen of such websites if sexuality would not be such
a big deal. things are getting better over time but i think there is still a lot
of room for improvement.

<h2 id="thecook">thecook</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a story about learning to ignore people.</p>
<p>
i love my mom&apos;s fried chicken with fries! i want to cook my own. i know! i will
become a chef and prepare fried chicken with fries all day long!
</p>

<p>
alright, let me start immediately. the book says i need batter, oil, chicken,
potatoes. potatoes must be fried for a while so let me start cutting that! ouch
i cut my finger and there is blood everywhere. no matter, i apply a bandage a
keep cutting. i now put the potatoes into the fryer and off it goes. i prepare
the batter, cut the chicken fillets, coat them with batter, and start frying
them too. oh, the fries are ready. let me take them out of the fryer, and pour
them onto a plate. i salt them too. what is this smoke i smell? oh god, the
chicken is on fire! i did not set the gas stove correctly and it started burning
while i was preoccupied with the fries. quick let me put out the fire. i grab a
0.5 liter glass, fill it with water and pour it onto the frying pan.
</p>

<p>
my first attempt did not go well. at least i can do my next attempt in a new
kitchen. before doing that i decide to learn about this cooking more. i read
books, watch cooking shows and so on. one of the common advice i have seen is
&quot;separation of concerns&quot;. it says that i should not try to do too many things at
the same time because i will be overloaded and i will not be able to follow what
is going on. that sounds reasonable.
</p>

<p>
okay, so now i have some experience: both practical and theoretical. let me try
this again. this time i do the chicken frying first. i prepare the batter, cut
the chicken fillets, coat them with batter, and start frying them. as i am
frying i watch the stove, adjust the settings. the chickens now seem the right
color so i take them out the fryer. my fried chicken is ready! now i can do the
fries. i start cleaning so that there is nothing else on my working table that
could distract me. i cut the potatoes. no finger cutting this time. i fry them
too. i wait, i take them out, and pour them onto a  plate. yay, i am done, this
will be awesome. i serve both my chicken and fries onto a plate and start
eating. ugh. the chicken is cold.
</p>

<p>
not too bad but i see there is more to learn in the world. so i study more. i
even attend a culinary course. they show me fancy tools and methods to follow. i
learn to be more efficient. there is not much benefit of cutting my own fries. i
can buy it frozen and it will be roughly the same. i can buy pre-battered fries.
and if i am very careful i can fry both of them at the same. i still need to
separate the concerns so i make sure that i fry in the opposite corners of the
kitchen so that i do not accidentally mix up the two. feels a bit weird but
sounds totally reasonable. after the frying is done, i serve the meal and
everything is fine! i can finally enjoy the fruits of my studies.
</p>

<p>
it is time for me to enter the big world. i start working at a big company among
many other chefs. we all prepare fried chicken and chips all day long together.
i learn lot from my colleagues. they even show me more advanced tools and
methods. i can now prepare this meal even more efficiently. i can see other
people also enjoying all the chicken and fries. life is wonderful.
</p>

<p>
time goes on. i feel a change in myself. something is not right. there is no
excitement anymore. is it because i do not like chicken and fries? no, that is
not it. i clearly like it still. then how come i do not want to do this all day
long? where did all the feeling of fulfillment from cooking go?
</p>

<p>
i start looking. i look at the cooking shows. they are all the same, do not
create any change in me and they seem boring. then one of the shows catches my
eyes. it has a special guest cook. a well renowned one. it piqued my interest
because this person seemed to be full of positive energy. it turns out people
find his meals masterpieces. yet people hate his guts for a reason still unclear
to me. i watch his cooking. then watch other people&apos;s reaction to his meal. i
feel excited again simply by watching him. but why? what is he doing
differently? i watch closely. after many hours analyzing the footage i distill
two observations. first he is like a barbarian. does not use most modern tools
he could use. he is not using the robopeeler, nor the robocutter for his
potatoes, he does all that by hand. this is silly but oh well. after the judges
start eating his meal, he continues to make adjustments and suggestions how to
consume the meal! he asks questions, suggests using a little bit of salt here, a
little bit of mustard there. he is quite eccentric. it went against everything i
learned: using tools and that my job ends when i serve the food. it is odd but i
want to be like him.
</p>

<p>
okay, but not use tools? this is silly but well, let me try it. this is painful.
i am cutting my potato and i just cut my finger again. i am frying my chicken
from my own batter without a timer and i overcooked it a bit again. and the
taste is quite meh. and my kitchen is a mess again. i have to clean it. but this
is odd. i feel calmness. i actually feel good now. i made the overcooked chicken
myself. i made it with my own hands. i did not need help from the robots. it was
me who put that chicken there. without me that overcooked chicken would have
been some other generic fried chicken again. i had a deep connection with that
chicken. this is fun!
</p>

<p>
the next day i do this again. this time i feel like i should go eccentric even
more and use crisps instead of breadcrumbs in the batter. this time i did not
cut my finger nor overcook my chicken. the chicken was really special, extra
crunchy. it was awesome! how come this is not the normal way to cook this? i
tell about this to some people and i get crazy looks. they never even bother to
try it. am i just imagining that this is that good? i continue experimenting
with various other tweaks. some work, some do not but i find a lot of joy in the
process.
</p>

<p>
so far all i did is the do stuff by hand. i want to try the second observation i
have noticed. the part where i actually serve my meal to others and see them
consume it. but where could i do this? i know! at my company!
</p>

<p>
i go to my coworkers and ask if they would mind if, when nobody is around, i
would use the kitchen to create a small dish for a few interested folks after
work hours. they say nice idea, go ahead. i am happy. i decide to create
something special that i cannot create at home because i lack a special
ingredient available only at work: cheese. so instead of fried chicken, i want
to create fried cheese. people still like the idea.
</p>

<p>
one of the company policies that whenever someone is in the kitchen, they must
have a coworker there for safety reasons. the coworker buddy is ought to stop
that someone from doing bad stuff and help out if accidents happen. there is a
guy i know who is really interested in all this cooking, i talk with him a lot
about cooking, i think he will be ideal as my buddy. i warn him i will be a bit
unconventional and then grab a potato and start peeling by hand. he immediately
stops me. i am doing this wrong. i should be using the robopeeler, have i gone
mad? i explain that this is really important. we start arguing about this. we
keep arguing until i actually manage to manually peel and cut the potatoes. i
start frying them. he is quite disappointed in me by this time. then i start
frying the chicken as well. he goes insane when he noticed that i did not start
the timer. &quot;frying without the timer is bad! it is very hard to know how long to
cook without the timer. and besides, it is company policy to always use the
timer!&quot;. then he grabs my frying pan, throws out my cheese out of it and gets
his own battered cheese, starts frying it but also starts the timer. &quot;see? this
is how it is done.&quot;.
</p>

<p>
on one hand he is correct. that is how this thing should be done. on the other
hand he managed to completely kill my mood and interest in this food. it should
not matter to me if the timer is going on for my chicken yet it does. simply the
timer being there annoys me. i do not get the &quot;i made this without robohelp&quot;
feeling anymore. i am getting back to the &quot;this is no fun, this is just plain
work&quot; state. what also annoys me that he also tells me how to do *my* stuff even
though he is completely uninterested in the end product, only in the cooking
process itself. i try to to explain that this is part of the magic i need in
order to make this meal but he does not budge. i get angry, do a super quick
cleanup and leave the kitchen because i do not see any point in continuing.
</p>

<p>
i keep thinking about the next step. i could leave the whole thing and just not
try make an interesting meal for a few folks. however i cannot let one person
get to me. i think i just need to change my buddy. there is this other guy. he
is pretty busy all the time just because he actually gets work done in the
company. he does not have time for petty arguments. but i will not get any
feedback or suggestions from him either. i ask him to my buddy and he comes. as
expected, he does not give much attention to me, he is doing his own job. on the
other hand i can finish my meal in the way i want. my guests come. i do not tell
them how i made this food other than it was a labour of love. i do not want them
to run away from me when they learn that i hand peeled and hand cut my potatoes
as in all the previous cases. i sit down next to the people who will consume it.
they like it. i feel happy about this. i recommend some salt here, some
mayonnaise there. i feel the fulfillment again.
</p>

<p>
people started liking what i create but at the same time people started hating
my guts. i am no longer pleasing all the people but in exchange i feel
fulfillment in my life again. i accept this tradeoff. all i need is to have the
courage to be disliked.
</p>

<h2 id="pain">pain</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>some pains can be embraced rather than drugged away.</p>
<p>
pain is a signaling system. it signals that something is not right. there are
two types of pain: sudden spike and chronic pain. if you suddenly feel pain then
most of the time something changed around you suddenly and you probably even
know the reason. in this case pain is a useful signal but it can get into the
way of resolving the underlying issue. e.g. if a bear is eating my leg then i
might just give up everything because it is too painful. maybe i would fight or
run more if the missing leg would not be bothering me. so in this case making
the pain go away might be very useful.
</p>

<p>
the chronic pain is different. and by chronic i mean the one that last for very
long time. i do not mean physiological pain only but mental too. inconvenience
might be a better term for the latter. we cannot simply wish the chronic pain
away. so what do we do? we medicate ourselves with painkillers. in the
inconvenience&apos;s case we start using various tools and gadgets to make things
more comfortable. this indeed makes the pain go away so it is a reasonable
solution.
</p>

<p>
however you could look at this differently. pain is something that you are
intrinsically motivated to alleviate. what if rather numbing the pain, you alter
your lifestyle in a way that the pain is manageable? with this approach you do
not feel at mercy of your doctors and drugs anymore. you feel that you are in
charge of life. you start researching your pain. you start experimenting with
things. basically you get a goal and start living. all your actions start to
have a meaning. the &quot;why am i doing this?&quot; feeling is not around. it is not an
easy life. every day you wake up, the pain greets you. it does not allow you to
slack off. you remain passionate about alleviating your pain.
</p>

<p>
and the nice about this is that you can always inflict pain on yourself.
depressed because you are invisible and there is no point in life? start walking
barefoot on the streets. you will immediately notice trash or dog poo on the
ground. you will start moaning how all this trash and dog poo is bad for us all.
you might start picking up the trash in your immediate vicinity in order to make
it habitable for yourself or at least arrange a daily cleaning service on your
street. you start fighting for clean streets. you now matter because you want to
achieve something. and that something is only about fixing your inconvenience:
making sure you can walk around barefoot without getting too dirty.
</p>

<p>
others will think you are crazy. they will try to talk some &quot;sense&quot; into you.
get shoes or else all sorts of bad thinks will happen to you. some people will
even get angry at you. do not let them to get to you or otherwise discourage
you. do not take naysayers seriously. ignore them. you cannot achieve something
without making some people angry. let them have their boring life. yours is now
full of excitement and possibilities. focus on that. after a while you will not
even notice the pain anymore. your body adapted to it naturally. it learned that
this pain might be okay after all and decided to not to bother you anymore. all
you need to survive is the initial period of the pain. do not underestimate your
body&apos;s and mind&apos;s adapting capability.
</p>

<p>
this does not mean that you should go all out and do all sorts of crazy stuff.
it works only up to a point anyways (yerkes-dodson law). and this takes a very
special personality. most people are not up to this. there are two lessons you
can take away: 1. if you ever feel uncomfortable, maybe keep yourself in that
state just a little longer just to see what happens, 2. if you see other people
doing crazy things despite the apparent pain, do not feel superior to them. all
the nice things we have today is thanks to crazy visionaries who went against
the establishment, made a lot of people angry and sometimes even suffered a lot
in exchange. try to understand their motivations instead. try to not obsess
about what and how they are doing things but rather what they are achieving.
after all, do not we all want clean streets?
</p>

<h2 id="complexity">complexity</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>avoid abstractions and things stay manageable.</p>
<p>
everybody hates complexity. yet at the same time msdp (&quot;modern software
development practices&quot;):
</p>

<ul><li>
  encourage adding complexity under the disguise of reducing complexity.
</li><li>
  discourage people from gaining the expertise to avoid complexity.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it is not done purposefully. complexity is painful. people do not want to
experience pain. so as long as people do not feel pain things are good. msdp are
like painkillers. they definitely do help not feeling the pain of complexity, no
argument there. but just because people do not feel it, it does not mean it is
not there. eventually people get so much painkiller into their system that they
cannot live without it anymore. and the eventual consequence of all this is
mental breakdown or burnout.
</p>

<p>
all software is a solution to a problem rather than an end in itself. what is a
&quot;problem&quot;? problem is a pair of states: input state and output state. there are
many sorts of problems:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i have a list of numbers -&gt; i have the average of those.
</li><li>
  i have an essay in a text file -&gt; i have the most common word of the essay.
</li><li>
  i time to kill -&gt; i am watching a video.
</li><li>
  i want to pay for the pizza -&gt; the pizzeria has my money.
</li><li>
  i am craving sugar -&gt; i have ice cream in my hand.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
software is that tiny &quot;-&gt;&quot; bit between the two states. in fact, the software
part is completely irrelevant! yet for complexity reduction msdp focus on that
tiny irrelevant part. this is what happens when people consider the software as
an end in itself. the focus should be on the problems instead.
</p>

<p>
take the first problem. it is quite abstract but for a programmer it is super
clear what it means. one can even mentally fill how the software works because
it is just that obvious. now take the last problem. it is very fuzzy and
subjective. it is unclear what the software will be between them. do we create
an online shop where people enter their feelings and we send the appropriate
item for said feeling? or do we create a software for mixing ice cream based on
how much sugar the human wants? it is super unclear what are we trying to solve
here. usually this fact does not stop people from firing up their editor and
start furiously developing stuff.
</p>

<p>
what is the difference between the two problems? the first one expresses a
problem via well known computer science terms: numbers, strings, lists. the last
problem expresses it via abstract terms that try to clearly identify the
concepts in question.
</p>

<p>
why is the software trivial in the first case, complex in the latter? in the
first case the two states are very objective. everybody agrees on what the two
states mean and can reliably tell what and what not matches those descriptions.
as such when people think how to solve the problem, they pretty much arrive at
the same solution so there are not many creative differences in its software
development process. in the latter case people cannot fully agree what
&quot;craving&quot;, &quot;ice cream&quot; or &quot;in my hand&quot; means. every person will have a different
understanding. they will have different assumptions. they will want to implement
different things. and in the middle of the development process they realize that
one team meant something completely different for &quot;in my hand&quot; than the other
team and now they are creating even more problems and software to bridge this
misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
what is the solution? the job of the software engineer is to reduce the
subjective states into the objective realm of numbers, strings and lists.
</p>

<p>
what does msdp recommend? numbers, strings and lists are unintuitive and hard,
we should abstract and create new terms. instead of &quot;list of numbers&quot; you have
&quot;grades&quot; of &quot;students&quot;. instead of &quot;average&quot; you have &quot;grade average&quot;. when you
define things like this, they start getting muddy. what is a grade? is it a
number? is it a letter? what is the grade average of &quot;a a a b&quot;? the more
abstract terms one introduces, the more muddy the problem and its software will
be. this is what i meant under &quot;msdp encourage adding complexity&quot;.
</p>

<p>
and to top it off, all the tooling msdp create are further exacerbate the
problem. it is all about object orientation, genericity and even type hiding so
that you have even less chance to understand what is going on. people are having
harder and harder time to communicate with each other just because of the sheer
amount of unclear concepts one has to hold in their head.
</p>

<p>
following this practice leads to very very long problem descriptions with many
many types of lists, strings and numbers for the various aspects of the problem.
yes. but the key observation here is that if you write all this out, then you
will see the problem&apos;s essential complexity in its natural form. it will be
ugly. it will be painful. but just because something is ugly or painful, does
not mean you should hide it. what you need to do is to learn to not mind that
ugliness. keep working with it and over time you will gain all the necessary
experience to spot and mentally chunk patterns just like professional chess
players can take a quick look at a chessboard and instantly understand the full
state (and if not then they know that things are messy and should be cleaned
up). if you are a doctor then it would be a quite weird if you would be
uncomfortable looking at dicks. no, instead the expectation would be that you
learn a lot about dicks so that you can look at any dick without problems
because that is the human body in its natural form. yet msdp recommend that you
do your best to hide all those dicks so that nobody gets uncomfortable. the
developer novices do not even have the chance to learn to recognize patterns.
they must work with new abstractions all the time. and if they break down
something too much, they are scolded that they are not following msdp. this is
what i meant by &quot;msdp discourage people from gaining expertise&quot;.
</p>

<p>
the next important task after breaking down the problem into numbers, strings
and lists is to document the mapping between the subjective and the objective
representations of the problem. even though msdp recommend doing this with all
that object oriented madness, this cannot be done formally. the only way to do
this is by writing informal prose. the writer of such mapping must meticulously
explain what each number and list represent in the subjective world. in other
words a software developer&apos;s task is not really to write software but to write
text!
</p>

<p>
this is no easy task. and why would people bother writing documentation anyways.
all the structure is super clear in their mind so the mapping between the
subjective and objective world should be super clear to everyone else too.
interestingly when most developers look back to their own code written in the
past, they think it is ugly and unnecessarily complex. in such cases the
assumption is that this is because they got smarter but that is not the case.
they would write the same code today too. the only thing they are lacking is the
context of their code. and the reason they lack it is because they did not
clearly document the input and output in simple terms. the other characteristic
of most developers is the feeling that they should refactor all the time. they
write something and they are very proud of it. then they try to actually extend
it they realize that what they wrote is not any good and they want to start from
scratch. they constantly want to reimplement things. as such their productivity
is pretty low. if you are thinking in terms of input and output then
understanding code is not hard and you do not get the feeling that your old code
is bad nor do you feel the inclination to refactor all the time.
</p>

<p>
suppose you are using linux every day. you get curious about the kernel. you
want to learn more. you download and open its source code. you barf. it looks
unnecessarily complex and think this is crazy. you even think maybe you should
write a new operating system from scratch just to show them how is it done. see
the problem? this is the &quot;software as an end in itself&quot; approach. if you open a
piece of code and say &quot;i want to understand this&quot; then you are doing it wrong.
</p>

<p>
what you need instead is a problem. you could say &quot;i have all these processes; i
want to know how can they run simultaneously&quot;. if you phrase it like this then
your first step is not to download the linux kernel source code and get
frustrated about its complexity. instead you first open the wikipedia and start
learning about processes. if you know everything about them then you start
learning about the schedulers. once you know about those, you start searching
about linux specific schedulers and you learn how do they work. at no point did
you need to open the linux kernel source to answer your curiosity. but suppose
no one is around to tell you what linux is doing. then you must download and
inspect the code. however in this case you already have the context: you know
the technical terms around both processes and schedulers. you know that you are
looking for a specific thing. you also know that this is a very core thing in an
operating system so &quot;drivers&quot; will not be the right directory. you can pretty
much tell what does and what does not look relevant to this. you find the
corresponding file and it tells you the name of the scheduler and even points to
docs. you got your curiosity satisfied without any complexity getting into your
way. all you really needed is to get accustomed to some objective terms and
concepts and then understand the problem in those terms.
</p>

<p>
software does not exist in vacuum though. it is used in a domain. if the domain
has well specified, objective terms for concepts, then using those when reducing
problems is fine. in the domain of computer system administration i work with
the following concepts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  files: contain all the data.
</li><li>
  processes: calculate all the data.
</li><li>
  rpcs: remote procedure calls for communication.
</li><li>
  machines: run the processes.
</li><li>
  users: isolate or limit the processes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if a state is expressed in these terms then i can probably understand it pretty
quickly. it is very easy for me to &quot;visualize&quot; the state in my mind. when i
visualize both the input and output state, i can sort of get a &quot;feel&quot; for what
is happening in between. if i start seeing &quot;tasks&quot;, &quot;channels&quot;, &quot;configs&quot;,
&quot;objects&quot; then things start getting muddy for me. people try to be nice and
&quot;hide the complexity&quot; but all it achieves that i am no longer able to see all
the pieces the software is working with. all i see is fog.
</p>

<p>
it might seem that some problems cannot be reduced to such simple terms. e.g. i
want to write a videogame but i do not really know what exactly the end result
will be since it will require a lot of iterations to get everything right. even
so, you still have a rough idea what you want. in a shooter you want a 3d
environment, players, enemies, weapons. you can break down those concepts into
their corresponding data structures, find some common problems that you are sure
you will encounter (moving around, collision detection), implement those, and
then go from there. the idea is that you should have a clear, objective mapping
between the concepts and their data representation in simple types.
</p>

<p>
another reason people are afraid of deconstructing things into their base forms
is that if they write out the full state like that in such simplistic terms then
it will be way too long and unhelpful. however length should not be an indicator
that you need an abstraction but rather that you need to think more to come up
with a simpler system. sometimes this is impossible: you want efficiency or good
usability and for that you need all those pieces. that is okay. in such case it
will be clear that we are trading simplicity for features. it will be also clear
when are we having way too much features and maybe start thinking in different
terms of approaching the problem.
</p>

<p>
take the case of long functions. msdp suggest that you should break down long
functions if it makes sense. this then reduces the number of local variables you
need and thus you reduce the state the &quot;poor reader&quot; has to keep in head. but
that makes no sense if you consider things from the input output perspective.
you are not reading a function for entertainment. if you are reading a function
then that means you are either trying to extend it or you are trying to find a
bug in it. in both cases what you really need is a good understanding of what
the function does. if all you see is just invocations to other opaque functions
then it will not be clearer what is happening. what you really need is a human
telling you what the function does in high level terms. when you have that
understanding, then you will also have a feeling where to put the missing piece
or where the faulty line might be. where are you going to get this if you do not
see any human around? you will get this from the comments. in other words what
you are really looking for are human comments in functions. and you need good
quality comments. how do you get that?
</p>

<p>
there is this phenomenon in in-person human communication: suppose someone is
explaining something to you. when they finish the explanation, they are looking
at you, waiting for a reaction. if you do not provide any reaction, the other
person will assume that you lost the thread and they will start explaining in
more detail. this also works with code! if you write a large chunk of code then
you will feel bad if you do not give a summary commentary in front of the chunk.
however small chunks feel obvious and as such they are left undocumented. if you
split up a large functions into many small functions, it is pretty much expected
that you will have less documentation and your code will be much harder to
understand.
</p>

<p>
good rule is this: when you see the same logic in 3 places then consider
factoring them into a function but no sooner. below 3 you simply do not know if
the abstraction you are creating is good. 3 and above it means that there is a
common concept hiding there, it might worth naming it. this process is called
semantic compression. note that this process applies when deconstructing state
too: if there are common structures (4 floats representing a vector) then it is
okay to define a structure for them (struct vector). but this structure is just
for naming a common concept, it is not meant to hide its elements or assign
functionality to them like you would do in object oriented programming.
</p>

<p>
since poor functions are one big source of complexity, let me elaborate a bit
further on them. you should treat a long function like you would treat a book.
it should start with an introduction what the function is about, what the inputs
and outputs are and then a table of contents of its logic for quick navigation.
do not use numbers for the sections because the numbers might get invalidated
quickly. make sure the heading names are unique so that the reader can quickly
navigate by text search. this does not really look nice in small examples but as
a quick demo a small example will do:
</p>

<pre>
 // return a solution to a^2*x + b*x + c = 0 (unspecified which one in case of
 // multiple results). x is an output-only variable (must be non-null). the
 // function returns true on success, false in case there is no solution.
 bool solvequadeq(double *x, double a, double b, double c) {
   // solve the equation using the following steps:
   // basecases: handle the base case.
   // discsqrt: calculate the square root of the discriminant.
   // returnres: calculate x and return it.
</pre>

<pre>
   // basecases: handle the base case.
   if (a == 0) {
     *x = -c / b;
     return true;
   }
</pre>

<pre>
   // discsqrt: calculate the square root of the discriminant. this platform
   // lacks sqrt so we implement our own approximation via newton&apos;s method.
   double disc = b * b - 4 * a * c;
   if (disc &lt; 0) return false;
   double discroot = 1;
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {
     discroot = discroot - ((discroot * discroot) - disc) / (2 * discroot);
   }
</pre>

<pre>
   // returnres: calculate x and return it.
   *x = -b + discroot / (2 * a);
   return true;
 }
</pre>

<p>
as you can see i inlined a sqrt (with the assumption that sqrt() was not
available). sqrt is a pretty well known and understood concept so it would be
okay to grant its own function. but there was nothing of value lost by just
simply inlining it given that it is only used from one place. you could argue
that this way somebody might add another sqrt or that when the platform gets its
sqrt support, nobody will replace this piece of code. now this might be true for
simplistic example, but for a more complicated example somebody would totally
reimplement frobnicate() even if a frobnicate() would have existed already (they
would call it dofrobnicate() so the compiler cannot point out this mistake to
them). and the second concern is not addressed by decomposition either. you will
still have identical pieces of code all around. and even if msdp would address
the issue of duplication, it is a moot point. remember, complexity does not stem
from duplication. complexity stems from the fact the concepts the code works
with are subjective and unclear. obsessing about duplication will not reduce the
complexity.
</p>

<p>
by the way, another trait of msdp is that they always demonstrate their points
using simple examples and for that they all seem convincing. demonstrating
complex examples is cumbersome so they never get to the point where they would
see their systems crumbling down under their own self-inflicted complexity.
</p>

<p>
some comments look superfluous in this small example just like having too many
subheadings in a small book is superfluous. i would not give this many comments
for a function like this. but for longer functions they can really help the
navigation. free form comments are much easier to read than
handle_the_base_case(). from such function name you do not know that it is
related to quadratic equations even.
</p>

<p>
if you squint enough, this is very similar to knuth&apos;s literate programming. the
difference is that in this case we do not generate a separate document for
consumption.
</p>

<p>
what would happen if you started breaking down a long function into short
functions and/or approach the problem in an object oriented programming way? the
essential complexity would still be present, you cannot eliminate that. however
it would add a lot of accidental complexity. you will get bunch of new problems.
you have to pass around state. things will look quite okay initially but it will
be a maintenance and debugging nightmare. when requirements change and you have
to tweak some functionality here and there, you will realize that you need to
pass around even more state. your function prototypes start growing bulky (and
the function names will be obsolete just as well as comments can become
obsolete). eventually you will end up in a codebase where the function splitting
look pretty much arbitrary and does not make any sense. or suppose you want to
speed up the above function. when you look at it like this, it is pretty obvious
that you can trade speed for accuracy just by decreasing the number of
iterations in the loop. you have immediately seen that. had everything been
abstracted away, such observation would have taken quite a while to arrive at.
or suppose you are trying to debug this function. you want to add print
statements here and there to dump state. if all state is available in this
single function, adding such print statements at a few tactical places is super
easy. doing the same in a heavily abstracted code is painful. the point if you
have a lot of abstractions then you spend a lot of time fighting against those
abstractions and this fighting is called the accidental complexity. this is why
all those abstraction fanboys want to refactor their codebase all the time. you
can avoid all this pain just by not abstracting at all until there is a clear,
objective benefit to it (you have at least 3 cases that you can replace with a
single concept).
</p>

<p>
another observation of the whole input output approach is that if the code does
not matter, then the choice of platform and programming language does not matter
much either. this is one of the reasons why c got very popular. it was not
trying push any methodology on people (other than the const correctness
nonsense). it implemented the basic features that people needed for structured
programming and it turned out that was enough for almost everything so it spread
like a virus.
</p>

<p>
this is getting already way too long so let me wrap up. if you disagree
everything written in this post, i ask you this: there are people who manage
complexity like this and it works really well for them. give them some space. do
not disregard their approach completely just because you do not agree. if
something is unclear when approached like this, just ask for better comments.
</p>

<h2 id="codeswap">codeswap</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>an experiment idea to compare coding style efficiencies.</p>
<p>
i am really curious how effective my &quot;avoid creating types&quot; approach would be
compared to the object oriented approach. i am thinking of creating an
experiment for it. not that i would ever conduct such an experiment but thinking
about it is fun. i am not even sure where would i get people for this experiment
but suppose that problem is solved. now imagine i have a room full workstations
next to each other like in a typical open plan office. the experiment would
involve having the participants solve a series of related programming challenges
on these machines under a time constraint. then they would need to swap their
solutions and continue working on other people&apos;s code. the swap also changes the
problem the participants are supposed to solve. there are two problems, the swap
is done a way that it changes the problem for everyone. to make sure there is no
language barrier, i would ask each participant to use the same language.
something simple, e.g. c, go or python. i would ask the participants to brush up
their language skills before coming to my test. i would also make the
environment equally bad for each participant so that the environment has very
little effect on the results. to be specific: all i would give them is just a
terminal that is split into two windows: left side runs the nano text editor,
right side runs a terminal app that shows how correct their solution is. every
time they hit save in nano, it updates the right hand side with the results. i
would split the experiment itself into the following phases:
</p>

<ul><li>
  intro phase: give participants their problems and have them read a
  motivational text how to approach the problems.
</li><li>
  design phase (30m): the participants can write code but they get no feedback
  on the right hand side yet. they are supposed to architect their solution
  during this time. nearing the end they are also expected to write a feedback
  how hard they thought the problem was or their general thoughts about the
  experiment. they can just write this feedback directly into their source code
  as free form text at the bottom, i will strip this out before compiling or
  swapping the code.
</li><li>
  implementation phase (30m): at this point the right hand window wakes up and
  starts giving feedback. if they worked well, the participants should be able
  to easily make their code compile and solve the subproblems correctly (the
  ones they have already implemented) and then just continue solving more
  subproblems. nearing the end they are expected to give feedback to the study
  at this point too. however at this point they should also leave some pointers
  what was done and what the next steps are for implementing more features. this
  should be aimed at the next person.
</li><li>
  continuation phase (60m): now the system swaps around the code. the students
  have to work with other people&apos;s code. they have to get familiar with it and
  continue working on implementing the missing features. the swapping phase also
  changes the problem so the students also need to get familiar with a different
  problem. nearing the end they should write more feedback.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i am not sure how to implement the swapping phase yet: i can either ask the
participants to swap desks, or i can make the computers shuffle the code around.
either one works. if the latter, i need to be careful to prevent participants
from saving utility functions somewhere for reuse. they should completely lose
everything they have written so far.
</p>

<p>
the two problems would be very similar when reduced to the core but they would
be phrased differently and put into different context so that it is not obvious
that it is the same thing. but at the same time the two problems must be
different enough so that the participant cannot just simply delete everything
and rewrite stuff from memory.
</p>

<p>
the motivational text would have 2 dimensions, totaling in 4 different texts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  one half says that having comments is an indicator of poor code, participants
  should design their code in a way that does not require comments. the other
  half says that comments really humanize the code, people should write a lot of
  comments to make the intent clear.
</li><li>
  in the other dimension one half says that abstraction is what keeps the code
  simple and straightforward. make the structure of the code similar to the
  structure of the problem. the other half suggests to avoid abstraction: try
  avoiding creating new types, try sticking to arrays and long functions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
after the experiment is done, i would ask them to fill a survey. for each phase
it would ask the following binary questions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  was it clear what you needed to do?
</li><li>
  did you find this task fun?
</li><li>
  did you feel productive?
</li><li>
  was it easy to work with the code?
</li><li>
  did complexity unnecessarily hindered you?
</li><li>
  do you feel you could have achieved more in a better environment?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
my hunch is that in the design/impl phase the nocomments+abstraction group will
feel the most fun, ease and productivity but the comments+noabstraction group
will get more stuff done. in the continuation phase:
</p>

<ul><li>
  nocomments+abstraction continues on nocomments+abstraction code: not fun,
  hard, unproductive.
</li><li>
  nocomments+abstraction continue on comments+noabstraction code: not fun, easy,
  productive.
</li><li>
  comments+noabstraction continue on nocomments+abstraction code: not fun, hard,
  unproductive.
</li><li>
  comments+noabstraction continue on comments+noabstraction code: not fun, easy,
  productive.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in other words: the continuation phase is not fun since people do not really
like to work on other people&apos;s code. working on non-abstract code will be much
easier and people will feel more productive afterwards. the
&quot;comment+noabstraction continues on comments+noabstractions&quot; group will have an
advantage though: if they followed the recommendation, they should have come up
with roughly the same structure so they should be more familiar with the new
codebase.
</p>

<p>
and if it turns out that is the case then i will be vindicated. most software is
just a different configuration of the same underlying concepts. there is no need
to abstract away all this but rather what is needed is learning to recognize
patterns. the professional chess example is very apt: pro chess players can
instantly recognize very complex state in the middle of a pro match. even though
they might even give some states a name (an abstraction), it is not the name
that helps them recognize the state but rather the fact that they worked with so
many different chess states so long. it is the experience that matters rather
than ensuring every little concept has its own name. in fact, take two random
pro chess players: if they talk different languages they will not be able to
talk with each other much. but show both of them the same chess board and it is
very likely that both of them will make the same next step. this next step is
obvious from the abstraction-free chessboard. yet if they cannot see the
chessboard, they will pretty much not be able to agree what should be the next
step solely because they do not know what the other person is talking about.
</p>

<p>
when working with code, all we can do is to project the code&apos;s concepts into
concepts we already know. for instance as part of my sysadmin work i often
project the software into the realm of linux system calls. i am very familiar
with those and as long as i can understand the code in terms of syscalls, i can
pretty much have a rough idea what it is trying to achieve and how. a code feels
complex when i cannot do this projection. so my recommendation is to stay on
this level, avoid creating concepts that have unclear projections onto the well
known concepts. and i am not saying to completely avoid creating new concepts.
rather only create a new concept if you have a handful of usecases (at least
three): then i can see the concept from various angles and i can learn why is it
an useful concept. otherwise it is just a like a useless signpost saying &quot;this
is a signpost&quot;.
</p>

<p>
anyways.
</p>

<p>
as for the problem: i am not sure about this yet. it needs a theme and a bunch
of small and easy problems related to that theme so the participants can solve
some of them. maybe something like this: you are managing a garden. your task is
to read the garden description and help the farmers answer a few questions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  what is the area of the garden?
</li><li>
  how many types of vegetables are there?
</li><li>
  which vegetable consumes the most area?
</li><li>
  can you render a map of the garden? (just on the console, not a picture)
</li><li>
  given the work needed for each vegetable, how much work does the farm need?
</li><li>
  how expensive is the garden to maintain?
</li><li>
  how much money can the farmer make of the garden?
</li><li>
  suggest a better, more money making plantation for next year.
</li><li>
  which two plantations are the furthest away?
</li><li>
  and a very hard one for the ultra productive people so that they do not get
  bored: can you draw a road network to connect the plantations? make sure
  everything is easily reachable but at the same time try to minimize the number
  of road cells you need.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
obviously i need to think more about this part but that is the rough idea. the
other problem could be very similar but it would be zoo themed. you would have
animals and zookeepers instead. or maybe school themed where you would have
teachers, students and grades. dunno, this is just an implementation detail.
</p>

<p>
thinking about this even gives me an idea on how to approach learning the ways
of software development if you have access to a buddy: both should start a
project each but nearing the end have the other person finish it. iterate this
(while occassionally changing buddies) until you feel confident in coding. every
time you do a swap, there is a lot of context that needs exchanging. but if you
do this often enough, over time it will be clear what sort of documentation or
coding styles you need to write or use to make your code easy to pick up. i wish
more people would be better experienced in this area of software development. oh
well. might be a silly idea but still interesting to me.
</p>

<p>
maybe if i were a university professor with lots of time on his hand, i could
conduct such experiments on my students. hmm.
</p>

<h2 id="fsbuf">fsbuf</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>buffering filesystem changes to avoid rw mounts.</p>
<p>
i&apos;m thinking of keeping my filesystems mounted read only on some of my linux
computers. i sometimes do stupid stuff and not touching disk by default sounds
like a sensible way to prevent accidents. what i would prefer instead is that
the operating system keeps my changes in memory and then i can review them and
once happy, commit them to disk. this mode also ensures that my disks are always
in a cleanly unmounted state, i can just simply turn off or restart the computer
anytime without bothering with proper shutdown procedures. i&apos;m not fully
confident that i want this because it also means that i&apos;m now forcing myself to
do an additional manual sync after each piece of work. but at least i want to
know how to do it. i haven&apos;t found any good tutorial on the internet so i
thought i&apos;ll write down my findings for my own future reference.
</p>

<p>
note that i am aware that i could just use git for everything, and perhaps copy
the whole homedir to a tmpfs and then just copy back the commited files. that&apos;s
one way, but i&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s possible to solve this problem in a more
general and transparent way.
</p>

<p>
by the way, that wouldn&apos;t be the only usecase you would consider this for. maybe
you want to continue using your disk as is, but occasionally you want to make
send the changes over to a slower, backup storage. there are probably some
better solutions for this, but the solution described here would work with any
underlying filesystem without too much of a hassle and performance loss.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ll use unionfs-fuse for this. don&apos;t confuse that with unionfs which is a
kernel module implementing the same thing, and don&apos;t confuse it with overlayfs
either which is another newer and fancier kernel module implementing similar
things. only unionfs-fuse allows modifying the underlying filesystems directly
without breaking its internal structures so it&apos;s the only system i can do online
merging without too much of a fuss. sure, there are some caveats and edge cases
where it wouldn&apos;t work, but i&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s rare enough to not bother
caring. and i&apos;ll call unionfs-fuse as unionfs from now on for simplicy.
</p>

<p>
and for example&apos;s simplicity let&apos;s suppose the following directory structure:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /home: the home directory i&apos;ll be working day to day. this is the directory
  unionfs will create.
</li><li>
  /homedisk: the disk backend of the /home directory. this is the read-only
  branch for unionfs.
</li><li>
  /homebufrw: this will be a tmpfs dir containing files that i haven&apos;t committed
  to the disk yet. this will be always mounted as read-write. it needs to be
  read-write because during the sync operation the sync script will move the
  files to /homedisk and then delete them from /homebufrw.
</li><li>
  /homebuf:  this will be the read-write branch for unionfs. it is a bind mount
  for /homebufrw that we can toggle into read-only mode during syncs so that
  nothing can alter the /home filesystem during a sync operation to avoid race
  conditions. the read-only switch is not necessarily needed, but i&apos;d prefer it
  that way to ensure nothing can break my sync scripts.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
also note that most commands here assume root as runner. it is possible to avoid
using root for most mount commands using clever /etc/fstab config but that&apos;s a
bit outside the scope of this tutorial so i&apos;ll leave it out.
</p>

<p>
make sure all 4 directories exist:
</p>

<pre>
  dirs=&quot;/home /homedisk /homebuf /homebufrw&quot;
  mkdir $dirs
  chown 1000:100 $dirs
</pre>

<p>
user:gid of 1000:100 usually means the default user and the default users group.
if you already have a /home directory, just rename it to /homedisk instead.
ideally you would set this up when you are not using said home directory. e.g.
you are logged out and setting this up as root, or setting the disk up from a
different system.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ll assume /homedisk is already mounted, preferably as read only. it might be
just a vanilla dir on / in which case i&apos;ll assume / is mounted read-only.
</p>

<p>
next, mount a rw tmpfs on /homebufrw and bind /homebuf:
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o mode=0755,uid=1000,gid=100 -t tmpfs tmpfs /homebuf
  mount -o bind,rw /homebuf /homebufrw
</pre>

<p>
now, mount the unionfs. run the unionfs command as your own user otherwise you
unionsfs will create its helper files as root and that&apos;s not ideal. you won&apos;t be
able to run setuid binaries from this directory, unfortunately.
</p>

<pre>
  modprobe fuse
  cd /  # to ensure we can unmount /home no matter where we ran the command.
  # note at this point / must be mounted as read-write in order to mount fuse.
  unionfs -o allow_other,cow,hide_meta_files /homebuf=RW:/homedisk=RO /home
</pre>

<p>
you should now see the contents of /homedisk under /home. feel free to make
changes to /home. all the changes will be persisted in /homebuf.
</p>

<p>
now comes the interesthing part: how to commit changes from /homebuf to
/homedisk? first, as a matter of good hygiene, remount /homebuf as read only
(and for some reason this remount propagates to /homebufrw too so mount that
back as rw which then doesn&apos;t propagate back):
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o remount,ro /homebuf
  mount -o remount,rw /homebufrw
</pre>

<p>
you can only do this if there are no open writers. you list the writers like
this:
</p>

<pre>
  fuser -vMm /home 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep F
</pre>

<p>
if you are very careful, you could do the merge even if you keep /homebuf open
for writing as long as you avoid deleting the files it has open for writing. i
won&apos;t support this case though in my usync utility.
</p>

<p>
next, remount /homedisk or / as read-write:
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o remount,rw /homedisk
</pre>

<p>
now all you need to do is to move the contents from /homebufrw to /homedisk. i
wrote a small script for this called usync (see /usync.sh). run that.
</p>

<pre>
  usync /homebufrw /homedisk
</pre>

<p>
after that&apos;s done, you can simply restore the mounts and continue editing /home:
</p>

<pre>
  mount -o remount,ro /homedisk
  mount -o remount,rw /homebuf
</pre>

<p>
and that&apos;s all to it.
</p>

<p>
to make things even more convenient for myself, i made the following &quot;bsync&quot;
script for myself:
</p>

<pre>
  #!/bin/bash
  set -ex
  wmount disk
  usync /homebufrw /homedisk
  wmount buf
</pre>

<p>
wmount (see /wmount.c) a setuid script that lets me switch between rw mounting
either the disk or the buffer but not both. the point is that my disk is mounted
rw only during running the bsync command. and i also see what files changed
since the last sync.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s one annoyance with the current set of scripts though: they don&apos;t handle
fuse&apos;s interpretation of deleted but still open files well. fuse handles such
deletion via a simple rename. it renames a deleted file into &quot;.fuse_hiddenXXX&quot;
file. this shouldn&apos;t be sync&apos;d to backing store and it also means that after a
sync, i cannot delete everything from /homebufrw. however this is not super
common scenario so my usync tries to detect this and bails out if it&apos;s the case.
it also prints out which processes are keeping such files open. in such cases
it&apos;s up to the user to make the tasks release their open file descriptors.
</p>

<p>
in any case, i&apos;m using this setup for a few days now and it seems to be working
well. it&apos;s a bit annoying way to use a computer but it definitely works.
</p>

<p>
edit: oops, looks like unionfs-fuse still has some rough edges. i found a bug in
it: https://github.com/rpodgorny/unionfs-fuse/issues/91.

<h2 id="liquid">liquid</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>an idea about how to implement liquid democracy.</p>
<p>
i always had problems with politics and voting. my problem with today&apos;s form is
that the system is way too simplistic and rigid. in the end the choice usually
boils down to choosing between two parties, the one you hate less. then wait and
hope things do not go way too bad. this is a false choice to me. i feel
completely disconnected from the process and therefore i feel like abstaining
until i see a better alternative.
</p>

<p>
i came across the liquid democracy idea which is pretty neat. i will not go too
deep into the details or merits of the idea but the main idea is that people can
vote on directly on the issues or appoint delegates that can vote on their
behalf in issues related to specific topics. people can change these delegations
at any moment. this makes campaign circus every 4 years somewhat obsolete which
is also a nice benefit.
</p>

<p>
it is also important to note that it is actually quite easy to migrate to a
democracy like this if people wish so. one can create party that provides the
above system and then commits to vote in the office according to the people&apos;s
wishes. if a person wants to vote for party x, they could still vote for this
proxy party and in the system they would set their preferences to follow party
x&apos;s votes. i understand politics is more than just voting but for the sake of
brevity i only want to focus on this part for now.
</p>

<p>
there is only one problem with this idea: it is not obvious how to maintain
anonymity in this system. i did a quick internet search but did not find much
discussion around the topic. i did find a lot of blockchain mumbo jumbo as if it
would solve anything in this aspect of the problem. or the other things i found
was questioning this feature of democracy which is also quite absurd. i am sure
there are lot of good solutions to this but before searching deeper, i like to
give it a thought of my own: how would i reinvent things with zero practical
knowledge. writing down just helps me make the ideas more concrete. i will get
everything wrong but at i might learn something out of this when i am reading
about serious solutions.
</p>

<p>
my system would have couple important concepts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  public profile: this is a person whose identity is publicly known and their
  votes are publicly visible for accountability. these people would be the
  &quot;politicians&quot; who would be publicly standing up for various things. anybody
  could register as a public person. voters can delegate votes only to public
  people.
</li><li>
  private profile: this is a user in the system without an identity attached.
  they can vote directly or delegate votes to public profiles. this is what most
  people would register as.
</li><li>
  issues: this is what people can vote on. you have a question and a list of
  outcomes that people can vote on. there would always be an option for
  abstaining, and also for marking the question as invalid or false choice. i am
  not sure about the voting algorithm though: i am vacillating between approval
  voting and instant runoff voting with optional preferences. i like the former
  for its simplicity. on the other hand the latter has even better properties at
  the cost of much harder decisionmaking at the voting time.
</li><li>
  tree of topics: each issue must belong to a specific topic. and each topic
  must belong to a parent topic (there would be a root topic). this is only
  needed for categorizing the questions for the convenience of delegations.
  think of topics as directories, issues as files in those directories if that
  makes it any simpler.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
had i a website for this, i would not allow much discussion to happen on the
site other than casting the votes. this way there is no need for moderation
which can avoid a lot of problems and makes the site lightweight. as to where
the votable issues coming from: that is a bit outside scope of this brainfart
but the general gist is that it would go through formal channels and the only
people that can suggest votable issues are the people who then agree to be held
accountable for the outcomes.
</p>

<p>
one familiar with the concepts of liquid democracy can probably already imagine
how one could create a system using the above concepts: after people log in,
they can see issues, cast their votes directly, or set up delegations to public
profiles for specific topics (e.g. healthcare, education, or just
education/highschoolers). they also see their historical votes, and what
delegation chain led to that vote if any.
</p>

<p>
however two issues remain: how to ensure one person can have only one account
and how can someone verify that their vote counted.
</p>

<p>
i assume that the country already has a way to uniquely identify its citizens
with some sort of official id card. i imagine this algorithm after i decided
that i want to participate in the voting anonymously:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i go to an official registration office where i show my id card and i receive
  a ticket in exchange.
</li><li>
  with the ticket i can register into the online system from home and
  participate in the votes for a limited time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
my main goal here is to ensure the fact that there is no computer system that
somehow associates my identity to my profile in the voting site. in order to
achieve this my idea is to split the registration into two steps done at a
different time by different organizations.
</p>

<p>
for simplicity let&apos;s assume the registration part happens in january (no voting
during that time) and voting happens during the rest of the year, from february
until december.
</p>

<p>
in january the first organization checks my identity and then it records this
fact into their database. this registration fails if i am already in the
database. the only thing the database records is the unique identifier on my id
card (e.g. social security number). then as a proof they (or some other trusted
organization) issue me a ticket which is a pair of public and private keys which
i can use as a proof that i correctly proved my identity. the ticket&apos;s public
key goes into a separate database so that the ticket is not linked to my id
number. the organization throws ticket&apos;s private key away, only the voter keeps
it.
</p>

<p>
on the 1st of february this organization would release the list of people who
registered for voting and the list of public keys of the tickets the system
generated. the two lists are not connected but they should have the same number
of elements. this way people could check who registered for voting and also
ensure that there are no invalid tickets maliciously generated (or if there are,
it&apos;s obvious). though the only way to audit the lack of invalid registrations
would be to confirm with every registered voter that they indeed registered.
independent auditors can probably use some statistical methods to estimate the
number of invalid registrations.
</p>

<p>
the second organization is the one that runs the voting site. in order to
register here you need a valid ticket from the first organization. you need the
private key for the registration and one ticket gives one registration only.
this way no person can register as another person unless they stole their
private key but in that case the former person cannot register. again, this
error is detectable even if not correctible. this system also does not collect
anything other than a (perhaps randomly generated) username and password. no
email address even to avoid the possibility of linking data after a leak (again:
users should use separate sites to keep informed about what is going on; i am
imagining an infrastructure service, not a social networking site). even the
ticket&apos;s public key is not linked to a specific user other than marked as used
in a separate table.
</p>

<p>
the registration is valid only for a year. people will lose passwords or have
their accounts hacked. since the system itself does not link accounts to the
real people, those accounts will be lost until their expiration. this would be
the cost of people not being careful with their password (a sort of perverse
democratic darwin award). however the damage is only temporary because next year
people can re-register.
</p>

<p>
the other problem is accountability of the votes. i think the solution for that
is just public dumps of the actual votes. after each vote the system releases a
big file that contains a row with 2 elements: random unique number identifying
the voter and the actual votes (the delegation chain would not be public, the
system resolves those automatically, only the final votes remain). the unique id
for the voters would change after each vote so that it is impossible for anyone
to track voters over time yet each voter can independently verify that their
vote is in the official dump.
</p>

<p>
and that would be the gist of it. obviously as it stands there are a lot of
rough edges that need careful thought. it does not rely on any wasteful
blockchain crap though. sure, it requires a trusted central authority running
this but as long as that authority is transparent, i do not see a problem with
this. if a society cannot arrange this, then no amount of blockchain technology
can save it. if it can then the blockchain tech is not really needed.
</p>

<p>
i can see a bunch of parties starting up. the only sad part of it that although
most of them embrace blockchain as the savior of earth, they do not care much
about anonymity. or at least they are not doing good job explaining why they ask
for my name and other data and how can i be sure that it will never leak away:
linking my votes and my identity. not that i particularly care about my votes
being public or not, i just want to make sure the system gets this aspect right.
i will look out for stuff like this and see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
by the way, speaking of blockchain. one of my annoyances with blockchains is
that they unnecessarily burn lot of computation away. it&apos;s wasteful. i&apos;m using a
fully central solution here. i think that&apos;s a fair tradeoff in exchange for
greater efficiency. the whole system i&apos;m describing here could run on a single
raspberry pi even for multi-million users. usually centralization happens for
saving resources. i don&apos;t have much qualms about this as long as centralized
component&apos;s scope and features are very limited.
</p>

<p>
and the actual decisionmaking might slow down, one won&apos;t be able to make
unpopular things into law since people won&apos;t vote on it. i think that&apos;s fair
compromise. if someone wants to make an unpopular change affecting the whole
population, i think it&apos;s fair that they should first convince the whole
population to want it rather than forcing it down their throat (as opposed to
convincing only a few politicians). or maybe try to convince smaller communities
to willingly canary some changes and only try for the global change if the
canary was successful. in any case, it might not be perfect, but i think it
would make people more interested in the whole political process.
</p>

<h2 id="task">task</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>my task management habits.</p>
<p>
like most folks i also have a barrage of ideas, requests, commitments, chores
and so on that i just need to do. since i don&apos;t have perfect memory, i need a
system for managing them. every person manages this differently: some just rely
on their memory, some use sticky notes, some use elaborate software, some use
bullet journaling, and so on. there&apos;s no system that works for everyone. i&apos;ll
now share what works for me.
</p>

<p>
first it&apos;s important to define what your end goal is. a typical goal is &quot;to be
productive&quot;. that doesn&apos;t work for me. i don&apos;t care much about productivity. my
primary goal is to become &quot;free&quot; - free of the tasks. ideally my todo list is
completely empty. if it&apos;s empty then it means i&apos;m pretty much free to do
whatever i feel like doing. that is usually daydreaming which usually leads to
bunch of new ideas which then fills todo list again. so even though the todo
list doesn&apos;t stay empty for long, it&apos;s super important to be able to
occasionally achieve 0 outstanding todo items. if i can&apos;t achieve that, then
that is a singal to me that i&apos;m doing something wrong and i need to sit down and
holistically reevaluate my priorities. keeping the todo list near empty means
you can be more flexible, can easily change directions, try new things, be super
responsive to people without feeling much dread about all the tasks you need to
do. but near 0 outstanding tasks is super hard to achieve regularly. however one
can create the illusion of low task load simply by hiding majority of the tasks!
not all tasks are the same. i&apos;m not really fond of hierarchies or labeling
things but i do have 4 categories for my tasks:
</p>

<ul><li>
  conditional tasks
</li><li>
  stashed tasks
</li><li>
  queued tasks
</li><li>
  archived tasks
</li>
</ul>

<p>
conditional tasks are the best! those are tasks that you want to do but you
can&apos;t. suppose you need to talk to a person about a topic but that person is
traveling. you can&apos;t talk to him until they come back. it means this &quot;talk to
person x&quot; task has a date condition. you just need to hide the task until a
specific date. or you want to remember that you need to do a regular, yearly
maintenance on your car. you can just add a task that is triggered on a certain
day of the year. you&apos;ll see the task in your todo list from that day on until
you clear the task. once you complete that task, you readd the condition to the
task but with the year bumped.
</p>

<p>
one might use a calendar for this. however that is wrong! the problem with the
calendar is that you&apos;ll see all the upcoming tasks if you look at a weekly or
monthly view of the calendar. if you see the task, you&apos;ll remember that you&apos;ll
need to do it at some point and you might start stressing about the upcoming
burden. and it&apos;s all pointless because you might not be able to act on the task
since its trigger date has not passed yet. it&apos;s really important to keep the
conditional task hidden until it&apos;s triggered. surprisingly many tasks can be
hidden simply behind a date.
</p>

<p>
on my personal computer i have a &quot;.rems&quot; file standing for &quot;reminders&quot;. each
line in it has the format of &quot;yyyy-mm-dd some arbitrary text&quot;. you might notice
that the filename starts with a dot which means it&apos;s a hidden file. i don&apos;t want
to be aware of this file. most of the entries from it shouldn&apos;t be triggering,
so i shouldn&apos;t care or know about them at all anyways. i also have a &quot;todo&quot;
script which prints a portion of this reminders file (among other things like
checking my email). it prints the lines whose date is in the past. i run my todo
script occasionally, yet most of the tasks from the reminders file stay hidden
until they are actionable by me. i can completely forget about those tasks and
still remain calm that i&apos;ll see them in time (unlike the calendar where i&apos;d see
the tasks all the time).
</p>

<p>
furthermore in certain environments one can be even smarter about this. at work
we have a relatively simple issue tracking system. each issue can have an
assignee field. if you have an issue assigned to you, you are expected to do
something about it. fortunately we have a nice robot to which you can reassign
these issues with a condition. you can tell it &quot;please assign this back to me
once that other issue is fixed&quot; or &quot;please mark this as fixed once that commit
is pushed&quot; or &quot;please assign this to person foo when person bar is back from
vacation&quot; and gazillion other actions and conditions. if you use this robot
well, you can hide a lot of your unactionable tasks. suppose you have an issue
assigned about a bug to you and you already created a commit to fix it and sent
it to review. at this point you can&apos;t do much about the issue, you are waiting
for the other person. so you tell the robot to keep the issue hidden until the
bugfix is pushed. after the review you push the commit. at that point the issue
reappears and you can, say, send out an announcement that you fixed the bug and
close the issue. having the issue hidden means cleaner dashboards, smaller todo
lists, and simply less mental tax. i love this tool at work and use it to keep
my work task count quite small compared to the rest of my colleagues.
</p>

<p>
you can also use conditionality to spread out tasks. one example is when you
have multiple issues that you have to solve in order. you can use the above
robot just to chain them up and in any given moment you&apos;ll only see the first
issue that you need to work on. once you close that, the next one appears
immediately. it makes work much streamlined - you always know what to work on.
this trick also works for unrelated tasks. there&apos;s only so many things you can
do at any given moment. you can decide that you create some sort of order over
the tasks based on importance and chain them based on that. for instance there&apos;s
a person i like to chat with and i always come across topics or ideas that i&apos;d
like to talk about or just get their general opinion on. but if they are
traveling i can&apos;t talk to them. at the same time i don&apos;t want to forget the
topics. i also can&apos;t talk about all the topics with them at the same time when
they come back. so in such cases i just chain the topics. i mark the first topic
to appear in my todo list once they are back and keep it there until i managed
have a talk about it. after the talk i go back to my machine and cross it out
and the next one appears - which i&apos;ll remember the next time i meet them. it&apos;s a
pretty simple way to keep many things in your todo list without being overloaded
by them.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s one additional benefit of the conditional tasks. the conditions
themselves also serve as a communicational tool. it communicates what a task is
waiting on. so if somebody is getting impatient with a task&apos;s state, they don&apos;t
need to bug you, but they can look and challenge the condition directly. e.g. if
an issue is waiting on a commit and the commit is waiting for a reviewer, then
they can ask the reviewer directly when are they going to finish the review.
</p>

<p>
my next big category is the &quot;stashed tasks&quot; one. some people call these the
iceboxed issues. a lot of times a random idea comes to my mind that i&apos;d really
like to do, investigate, experiment with further. however often such tasks are
not super urgent or important. i just want to be sure i don&apos;t forget about them
until i completed said task. sometimes i want to keep a thread of thought open
somewhere until i make my mind up about something. basically these are tasks
that i want to track but not to be reminded about. since i don&apos;t look at this
list proactively, this list tends to contain a huge number of tasks. but that&apos;s
fine. i encounter many ideas day to day. if i don&apos;t write them down into a safe
place, i tend to obsess about the idea a bit because my brain doesn&apos;t want to
let go of it until it senses some sort of closure. writing it down to my stashed
tasks lists gives it that closure.
</p>

<p>
ideally this list shouldn&apos;t be growing unbounded. it would be only consulted
when the primary todo list becomes empty just to find new things to do or when i
left some notes about some particular topic which i now want to look up. if i&apos;m
looking at it because i don&apos;t have better things to do then i can either do some
of the tasks i always wanted, or just clean up old, irrelevant entries from the
stashed tasklist. one always feels pretty good after such a cleanup.
</p>

<p>
i implement this by having a simple &quot;.ideas&quot; free-form text file on my computer.
i just randomly add stuff to it whenever i think of something. it&apos;s also a
hidden file since i want to keep it out of sight. i do have a little structure
to this file since it is quite long. each task has a title and i prepend a &quot;#&quot;
sign for those titles. the subsequent lines are the notes related to the task.
the nice thing is that this way i can have a quick overview of all my stashed
tasks simply by running &quot;grep ^# .ideas&quot;. i don&apos;t use more structure than this.
</p>

<p>
at my work there are several ways to achieve stashed tasks. the issue tracking
system actually supports two levels of assignments: &quot;assigned&quot; and &quot;accepted&quot;.
in theory you can assign any issue to anyone and the other person should mark
the bug as accepted once they plan to work on it. so technically you could use
&quot;assigned&quot; for the stashed work and &quot;accepted&quot; for the work you actually want to
work on immediately. however this distinction is not well understood, recognized
or used so even though i could use it personally, i don&apos;t do it. in fact, i try
to avoid stashed tasks at work completely. if i have such work related
unimportant idea, i write it to my personal .ideas file. at work i&apos;d just simply
close or unassign such an issue. this clearly and unambiguously signals to other
people that i do not plan to work on an issue. you can also add issues to a
&quot;hotlist&quot;. basically it&apos;s like twitter hashtagging but for issues. you can add
arbitrary issues into arbitrary hotlists. e.g. you could create a &quot;my stashed
issues&quot; or &quot;icebox&quot; hotlist, and just add issues of interest into that. you can
keep the issues unassigned so people who want to see the status of an issue can
clearly see that nobody is working on it. this approach also works on a team
level. if a team wants to track some issues but not work on them, they can hoard
them in such an icebox hotlist. generally speaking such hoarding is not very
healthy but it can make people feel calmer due to having a place to gather
thoughts about certain issues.
</p>

<p>
when one works with documents or source code, they can also leave todo comments
in the middle of the document. it&apos;s a very low overhead way of tracking tasks.
at my work they have the form &quot;todo(username): some text&quot; or &quot;todo(issue/12345):
some text&quot;. i&apos;d treat &quot;todo(username)&quot; as a queued task (will explain shortly)
however &quot;todo(issue/12345)&quot; is less clear. if issue/12345 is a stashed task then
that todo comment task can be treated pretty much as stashed as well. you can
think of these as mini-issues that block the main issue. at my work we even have
a cronjob that periodically crawles the whole source tree looking for such
comments and marks such occurrences in the linked issue. for each issue people
can see all the outstanding blocking issues and todo comments as well. they
shouldn&apos;t close the issue until they clean those up. in fact they receive a
warning notification if they close an issue nevertheless. but the point is that
you can keep tasks right in your primary work documents as long as you have the
tooling to manage them.
</p>

<p>
next up are the queued tasks or active tasks. these are the tasks that you think
you&apos;ll be able to work on in the next few days. you really should keep this very
short. in a perfect environment without disruptions you should be able to finish
all of them within a week. if you can&apos;t because you have so much or so big items
on this list, then the list is pretty much useless. it&apos;s useless because then
there are tasks on it that will be never addressed, basically tasks that should
be stashed. however just because they are in your active tasks you&apos;ll see them
every day. you very quickly start to ignore those items. if you ignore one item,
you&apos;ll very quickly start to ignore other items. this then snowballs: you pretty
much don&apos;t even use this list to guide what you should be working on next. it
just drags you down mentally, reminding you that you&apos;ll never be able to reach
the nirvana of 0 tasks. this is why i prefer the term &quot;queued&quot; tasks. it means
you can&apos;t allow things to linger in this list. if possible, you should go
through the tasks in fifo manner - first in, first out, no matter what the task
is. even though it might not sound a super productive strategy but it builds a
good habit of not hoarding tasks. i often have some very small idea i want to
try. before i forced myself to use the fifo rule, i pretty much procrastinated
on such ideas and eventually even dropped them because i got bored by hoarding
them in my todo list. with the fifo rule, i&apos;m forced to be more exploratory and
i actually learn ton of new stuff this way. simply because i force myself to
work on or explore the random unrelated ideas i queue up in my active tasklist.
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s super important to keep this list realistic. only put stuff into that
you&apos;ll actually get to in the order of days. there&apos;s on exception: if your task
is big, then it&apos;s okay to keep an entry about it in there as long as you chip
away at the task every day. you can also put untriaged items into this list. for
example you can treat reading your unread email as your queued tasks. some
emails might prompt for additional investigation, you might keep this email in
your queued tasks until you figure out how to respond to it. the task itself is
the fact that you have to figure out the response.
</p>

<p>
you can even try some psychological tricks to reduce the number of tasks. a lot
of my personally generated tasks are just ideas that i really want to explore
and experiment with. you could save some time yourself if rather than just
jumping right into implementing the demo, you talk about the idea with someone
first. this means the task now is not implementing stuff which can take long
time and requires a lot of motivation to start, but rather just having a chat
about it with your buddy. basically transform the task to scheduling a meeting
with your buddy. the original task becomes conditional - the condition is a date
that is after your meeting. this is also a great way to get out of your comfort
zone and make yourself talk to other people. all being motivated from the fact
that you want to keep your queued tasklist small. and not only that, you might
even learn new things. your buddy might point to an already existing thing, give
you tips on how to simplify things and so on. there&apos;s not much to lose from this
trick.
</p>

<p>
management of these tasks should be relatively low overhead. different kinds of
tasks need different tools for optimal maintenance. my first tool is an
unstructured &quot;todo&quot; file on my computer. i just queue stuff to the end, and pop
stuff from the top. popping the top is not a strict rule, but just an ambition.
most of my own ideas land in this file. often i write an idea down there, and
once i&apos;m done with the initial brainstorming, i just move it to the stashed
tasks. however i might not always have an access to my machine. in those case
i&apos;ll open a draft email in my gmail. gmail adds a quite visible marker if you
have a draft so i&apos;m always aware of my drafts. however i strive to move my
drafts to my todo file from above once i get back to my personal computer. i do
this just to reduce the amount of places i have my tasks.
</p>

<p>
note that this &quot;todo&quot; file doesn&apos;t start with a dot - it&apos;s not hidden. making
this file present in my home directory reminds me that i have stuff to do. if it
were empty, i could just delete it. actually all non-hidden files and
directories in my home directory mean some form of outstanding item for me. if i
start working on a demo or experiment, i just create a directory for it in my
home directory and keep it there until i&apos;m finished with it. then i just either
delete it or move it to my &quot;.d&quot; hidden directory which contains all sorts of
random stuff. stuff that i need to keep around (e.g. a checkout of my dotfiles
git repo) or various random stashed things. &quot;d&quot; stands for &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;disk&quot;
suggesting i archive most large things under that directory. if i want to keep
something around for later work, i make a note of it in my stashed tasklist, and
move it to my &quot;.d&quot; dir. if i want to pick it up again, i can just either move it
back or simply symlink the directory from my home.
</p>

<p>
the next big source of active tasks are the email messages. email management is
a huge topic on its own, i probably can&apos;t do much justice to it. but let me try
to give it a short summary. there are 4 kinds of emails:
</p>

<ul><li>
  an actual conversation you have with someone,
</li><li>
  a notification of something personally relevant to you,
</li><li>
  a feed item, news, random chatter,
</li><li>
  items of interests that you won&apos;t read but want them to be available when you
  look or search for them.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the first two categories are fine with me, i&apos;m happy to receive them since they
usually mean that i have to act on them. i don&apos;t have the 4th item at all. i
unsubscribe for all unnecessary updates and alerts. if i don&apos;t read it, i won&apos;t
know i can search for it anyways. at work usually such mails go to google groups
archives too so i can just use google groups search to find such emails. i&apos;m
quite strict about the third category. i subscribe only to a very few and
relevant feeds. if the feed only has an occasional post then it&apos;s not bothering
me. if it&apos;s high volume then i try to make it less high volume by trying to
eliminate unnecessary spam from it right at the source (e.g. i ask the robots to
stop spamming). if that doesn&apos;t work, i just change google groups to send
updates in bulk (so my inbox can remain clean) or just unsubscribe entirely and
remind myself to check on the group occasionally. i either just rely on my
memory to check on the feed - if i forget then it&apos;s probably not that
interesting anyways, so it&apos;s a good riddance and i can enjoy the additional free
time i got by not reading the feed. or i might add a date conditioned task to
check back on the group - usually for work related stuff i ought to know about.
but i try to keep these to the minimum. but it&apos;s all a moot discussion since
these don&apos;t generate tasks for me unless it&apos;s a list that i&apos;m supposed to give
support on.
</p>

<p>
anyways, let&apos;s get back to the main topic. whenever i see something in my inbox
that needs some further action or thought from me, i just simply star it.
starred emails are also part of my queued tasks. it might be the case that such
an email is either just good but long thread that i don&apos;t have the time to read
now, or it&apos;s blocked on something. in those case my action for that starred
email is to make a note of it in either my stashed or in my conditional
tasklists and then simply unstar it. that&apos;s pretty much my workflow: i read all
my email, i star the things i need to something about, and then when i have
time, i address the starred items. again, i actually follow up on those emails
quite quickly, i don&apos;t hoard them.
</p>

<p>
i also consider issues assigned to me as my active tasks. i either actively work
on them, or just reassign them either to someone more knowledgeable or to the
robot in case it&apos;s blocked on something. one annoyance with the issue tracking
system that most updates generate an email to every person cc&apos;d on the issue.
however fortunately my work&apos;s issue tracking system allows editing some of the
comment updates: you can edit your own comments and the issue&apos;s first comment.
these edits don&apos;t generate an email notification. so you can pretty much keep
updating an issue&apos;s first commit to match the &quot;explain the issue; explain the
status; make note of outstanding tasks&quot; format there. and then you make it a
personal habit to check and update the first comment before closing an issue.
</p>

<p>
the next tool i use is our internal code review tool. each commit has an author
and a set of reviewers. usually the author and the reviewers exchange comments
and changes until everybody is happy with the commit which is then pushed. the
tool itself has a very handy &quot;attention tag&quot; feature to manage whose turn it is
to respond. it&apos;s a boolean flag on the author and each reviewer. when the author
sends out the review request, the attention is on the reviewers. when the
reviewers respond, the attention moves to the author. people can flip the
attention on the individuals manually but by default the tool is quite smart
with managing it automatically. whenever i have the attention for a commit, a
small browser extension starts glowing. by default it is gray so when it
switches to a bright color, i notice that quite quickly but doesn&apos;t interrupt me
in any way in case i&apos;m in the flow. if a commit has my attention, i treat it as
my active task and my goal is to review the commit or respond to the comments
depending whether i&apos;m the author or a reviewer. even when i&apos;m the author of a
commit, once i send it out for review, it pretty much disappears from my active
tasks and i can immediately focus on other things. note that i can send the
review request to a robot along with a condition here too. the robot will keep
the attention tag on itself until the condition is true. then it assigns back
the attention and leaves the review thread. this gamified workflow of attention
tag ping-ponging makes it very gratifying to stay on top of the review workflow.
</p>

<p>
so those are my main channels for the active tasks. again, it&apos;s super important
to ensure you treat them in timely manner. in fact, it&apos;s best if you commit that
every day you&apos;ll start your day by addressing or making progress on your oldest
item from your queued tasks. the benefit of doing this is that you always have a
clear task to start the day with. once you do that, you&apos;ll feel that you
achieved something, and you&apos;ll be even more motivated to do more things rather
than just procrastinating all day on the internet. however in order for this to
work, your tasks in this list must be crystal clear rather than vague. if you
have a task which is unclear on how to solve, then your task is to figure out
how to solve it. most of the time it means writing to a support list or just
scheduling a meeting with your mentor or buddy to give you guidance. reaching
out to a person is always relatively easy, so you should always be able to do at
least that, no matter what the task is.
</p>

<p>
next up is the archival of tasks. i neglect this most of the time. however now
and then i want to be able to remember that i did something and how i did
something. i want to be able to refer back to my old notes. i don&apos;t worry about
this at work because the issue tracking system will keep all the notes and
comments around viewable by anyone. the more interesting question is what to do
with the completed personal tasks. the simplest thing to do this is just to have
a private journal. every time something comes up, you just append a note to the
end. in fact, i hear that doing daily journaling is quite healthy for one&apos;s
wellbeing. sometimes if i&apos;m in the mood, i do write some notes about every day.
but i quickly run out of steam. but if some important happens, i usually always
add it to my journal. i keep a &quot;.notes&quot; file in my machine and just write to it.
every new year i rotate this notes file. i just put the contents of the journal
into an email and send it to my email address. this way i don&apos;t have an ever
growing file on my machine and i can easily refer back to my notes via the email
interface&apos;s search facilities.
</p>

<p>
there are other ways to archive tasks and ideas. one way is to write about them
to someone. if i learn about a nice idea or nice article, i often just send it
to a buddy along with some personal comments. one, this sometimes starts a nice
discussion, two, i can easily refer back on the letter later. the benefit of
doing this over the journal is that it&apos;s much easier to remember about this
because you also talked about it with the other person. so even if you can&apos;t
remember how to find your notes or article again, you might remember who you
talked to about it, and just ask them if they remember anything. basically you
are outsourcing your memory to other people. it&apos;s also a nice way to keep some
social interactions alive.
</p>

<p>
another alternative is to write a public blog post about the idea. i think this
is one the best things you can do if you have the guts to publish stuff online.
this forces you think about things very carefully, forces you clear up your
thoughts so that they can be put into words. and if you are not shy, you can
even share the post with others. once it&apos;s published, you can pretty much forget
about the idea, unless others come back to you and become interested in your
specific idea. it can also act as a nice survey to see how good an idea is. if
people don&apos;t seem to show interest after you show it to them, maybe it&apos;s not
worth pursuing it. if they do, that interest can actually act as a motivation to
start working on the demo. having said that, i don&apos;t popularize my blog. i write
a lot of crap here that might be better if people wouldn&apos;t know about me. maybe
when i&apos;m older, this will become easier and i won&apos;t care about all this. it
would be awesome if people would ask me about my posts after i wrote them
though. but i don&apos;t want to keep notifying them about my posts - i want them to
learn about the posts because they are interested in the posts and explicitly
started following me. i want genuine interest rather than pleasantries. but for
that i&apos;d need to learn to write interesting posts, but let&apos;s postpone acquiring
that skill for a later day.
</p>

<p>
having said all that, there&apos;s no reason you can archive a task only in one
place. you could write a post, share it with a friend, and then finally mention
it in your journal. in fact, that would be probably the ideal habit if you have
the grit for it.
</p>

<p>
if you see some very old tasks in the stashed lists, then they are very good
candidates for archival. in fact often it&apos;s best just simply decide not to do
some tasks. give some thoughts about it, write down how you would go about them,
publish them on the blog, and then just forget about them. at least this way you
give yourself the closure that you gave the idea some attention but still didn&apos;t
waste too much time on it. and since it&apos;s on your blog, you know you can always
refer back to it from anywhere if you feel nostalgic about an idea. or just
point to your blog entry whenever you see somebody else thinking of a similar
idea. ask them to take a look at yours to see if they can use that as an
inspiration.
</p>

<p>
anyways, that&apos;s pretty much how i manage my tasks currently. although i wrote
quite a lot and i need custom tooling, i think my system is relatively simple -
mostly consisting of 3-4 unstructured text files for most cases. i wrote a lot
because the system is quite powerful and needs lot of explanation to explain
said powers. i&apos;ve seen more complicated systems used by people which eventually
turned out to not being very effective for them. especially after they ran out
of steam maintaining the required process or structure. task management must be
low overhead. and i&apos;d reiterate again, task management won&apos;t get you out of
unproductivity and procrastination. i&apos;m not using this for that purpose. i&apos;m
using this system simply for tracking and making an order of my outstanding
tasks and ideas in a relatively low-overhead but featureful system. although i
haven&apos;t tried, a similar method can scale up for teams as well, not just for
individuals, it just needs careful thought. i&apos;ll spare the speculation about
this aspect for now though. i&apos;m still relatively new to managing my tasks this
way (couple months) but let&apos;s see if it crumbles down or not.
</p>

<p>
edit after a few months later:
i now have a little structure in my todo files.
i start each task with a hash followed by an identifier name.
this is optionally followed by a colon and a summary.
the rest of the lines can be just details.
my todo script only lists the identifiers and their summaries.
this means i can add many details to a task,
they won&apos;t add much visual noise when reviewing them.
for identifiers i use the format &quot;[a-z][a-z0-9]\{2,14}&quot; to keep them simple.
basically i limit them to 3-15 alphanumerical characters.
example content of my todo file:
</p>

<pre>
  #email
  dear recipient!
</pre>

<pre>
  here&apos;s your email!
</pre>

<pre>
  thank you!
</pre>

<pre>
  #tell: tell my partner that i finally sent that email!
  #addreminder: do this after sending the email!
  add a reminder to check in with recipient
  that he got the email i wrote in #email.
</pre>

<p>
and when i run my todo script, i get this:
</p>

<pre>
  $ todo
  #email
  #tell: tell my partner that i finally sent that email!
  #addreminder: do this after sending the email!
</pre>

<p>
you can see that in #email i have some longer text yet it&apos;s not printed above.
and the nice thing about naming the tasks is
that i can refer them like i did in #addreminder.
i find it quite convenient.
and the todo script is incredibly simple too:
</p>

<pre>
  grep &apos;^#[a-z]&apos; todo
</pre>

<p>
the only thing i need to avoid is accidentally starting a line with #.
this could be a problem if i would be reformatting lines to 80 characters.
but with semantic breaks this is not a problem (see my /sembr post).
</p>

<p>
and if you truly do your tasks in fifo manner,
then you can add the dependent tasks simply in subsequent lines,
and not bother about somehow explicitly marking dependencies to auto-hide them.
</p>

<p>
i think this is a nice demo about many good practices working together in a way
that allows you manage things quite effectively yet in a very simple manner.
</p>

<h2 id="shooter">shooter</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>an idea for a simple fps game.</p>
<p>
this is another of those fantasy posts where i think aloud what sort of game i
would try to make if i had infinite time, motivation and energy to do things. in
the past i sometimes did sit down and start working on a game but i always gave
up after the initial excitement evaporated. at this point, i&apos;m happy if i can
simply formulate what i would do. this way maybe my brain can give the obsessive
thoughts about the game a rest.
</p>

<p>
so usually when i think about making a game or software, i try to think only
about making the core work well and not care about making it fancy or good
looking. for me if the core is good, i don&apos;t need fancy graphics or user
interfaces. in fact, they would just get into the way. i&apos;d only need fancy
graphics if the core is just not good enough, and i&apos;d need some sort of eye
candy that sort of hides the fact that the underlying game is actually boring.
unfortunately most modern games are like that: they look very fancy but are
actually quite boring if you were to remove fancy graphics and replace it with
simple shapes (e.g. spheres). the question is: can you make a shooter that is
fun in itself even if it just consists of, say, spheres. e.g. each enemy and
each projectile, (hell, maybe even the walls) are just spheres?
</p>

<p>
one of the reasons i&apos;m actually not interested in making such a game, because
there is already one good free single player shooter game: brutal doom when
played on the original doom 2 maps. it runs on a relatively simple engine so it
can&apos;t do too fancy stuff. but what remains is basically superb. good feedback on
the enemies, good gun mechanics, good maps, no unskippable videos, no overlong
loading durations, no high computer requirements. it just gets everything pretty
much right. i couldn&apos;t find any other game coming near to the utility of this
doom 2 mod. actually, most modern games try to model things more and more
realistically which actually works against the fun of the game. if i wanted a
really realistic shooter, i&apos;d just go play paintball in real life. even though
we already have brutal doom, i wonder, can you go for a significantly simpler
game and still have it quite fun?
</p>

<p>
one of hard the problem of games is content. in case of shooters you need some
maps and some motivation and goal for shooting all the enemies. i really hate
the overly abstract games where you only play for scores. i&apos;m not very
competitive person, i want to enjoy the game alone, on its own, or if
multiplayer, then it should be some sort of cooperative game where you have to
play together to achieve a common goal rather than competing against each other.
competition is only fun while i&apos;m winning but if i&apos;m constantly on the losing
side, the game becomes quite boring for me. most of the time i don&apos;t want to
invest into the game enough to become competitive so i just stick to single
player games.
</p>

<p>
in this hypothetical game i would take the maps of doom 2. i like those maps
since structurally they are 2d maps yet they still contain rooms with various
heights so the fights have a vertical element. however good maps are not enough
alone. so i&apos;d also add some short story progression text between the level
transitions. i&apos;m not sure what sort of text but each transition text should have
the following properties:
</p>

<ul><li>
  it&apos;s short. about 5-10 lines of text (assuming 80 character lines).
</li><li>
  explains what the player achieved or learned in the previous area story-wise.
</li><li>
  shows a simple overview of the next area and their objectives (e.g. where the
  keys and corresponding doors are).
</li><li>
  explains why the player is entering the next area story-wise.
</li><li>
  mentions some hints about the map secrets so the player has something to look
  out for.
</li><li>
  progresses the main storyline in a suspense building way. the player should
  want to finish the next map just to see what happens.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if it&apos;s possible, a few comics would also work but that sounds way too much
effort. text is enough if one is going for simplicty.
</p>

<p>
on the technical side, i&apos;d just hardcode the game resolution to 640x360. if the
graphics and gameplay are quite simple, it doesn&apos;t need a lot of detail. then a
smaller scale is more than enough. smaller scale means that the game is more
performant, it will work on very weak machines too. having a fixed resolution
makes a lot of things very simple: i wouldn&apos;t need to deal with supporting all
sorts of aspect ratio issues, making sure my fonts and heads up display are
legible, and many other things like that. i picked that resolution specifically
because scaling it 2x will get me 720p, scaling it 3x will get me 1080p. i like
such exact scaling because then the game can remain pixel exact. i don&apos;t like
blurry things.
</p>

<p>
there would be only one weapon in the game. i think it&apos;s important to pick one
weapon and focus on making the gameplay fun with that. i understand that game
can be more compelling if it has a lot of variety but that is not my goal here.
what i&apos;m trying to see if you can make a shooter based on a single gun
compelling enough. but what weapon should i pick? most shooters have 4 common
weapons:
</p>

<ul><li>
  sniper gun
</li><li>
  tracer gun
</li><li>
  shotgun
</li><li>
  projectile gun
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the first option is the sniper rifle with an optional zoom: this is a hitscan
weapon for very long distance battles. this can be quite rewarding but at the
same time quite frustrating if you have bad aim. it&apos;s also quite boring in the
sense that you are usually quite motionless, the movement is not that important.
so this gun doesn&apos;t satisfy the fun in the movement dimension. there&apos;s also the
problem of dealing with lag in multiplayer games. getting the correctness right
is quite a hard problem. one doesn&apos;t want to experience the fact that they
correctly clicked on a target, yet the server refused to acknowledge the hit. so
if one wants multiplayer, sniper rifles can get quite tricky to implement
fairly.
</p>

<p>
by tracer guns i mean guns that are hitscan weapons with high fire rate. the
player needs to trace the enemy continuously - keep aiming at the enemy while
continuously attacking to slowly destroy the enemy&apos;s shields and health.
examples are the machine guns in most old shooters, the lighting gun in quake 1,
the link gun in unreal tournament, or most rapid or continuous fire guns. these
are usually mid range weapons. my problem with this sort of guns is that they
are not as satisfying as the other type of guns. with a sniper rifle or shotgun,
you can eliminate the enemies with one shot if you are lucky. that&apos;s satisfying
because you get an instant feedback for an action. with tracer guns the gameplay
feels like a grind. gears of war contains lot of action like this and i find
that boring. that game feels like a chore. so i&apos;d totally avoid building the
main gameplay around this.
</p>

<p>
i love the overpowered shotguns in some of the games. brutal doom has it pretty
good. what i love about them the most is that in close range you can instant
kill the enemy, and gibs of the enemy fly away. it&apos;s a very satisfying thing.
and this also requires good amount of movement skill too. you have to run back
and forth against the enemy for the attacks because the shotgun is ineffective
outside its range. this is quite fun but the problem i think i have is that most
of the satisfaction comes from the effect of the gun rather than the skill of
the player. it&apos;s not super hard to play with it. and if you go with pure
graphics, a lot of the gun feedback goes away and it won&apos;t be as enjoyable, at
least not for long.
</p>

<p>
by projectile guns i mean guns that shoot flying projectiles that travel at
moderate, constant speed. think of the rocket launcher of quake and unreal
tournament, or the shock rifle&apos;s alternative attack in unreal tournament. i also
assume that this gun is not fast firing, so there&apos;s some delay between the
shots. i never really liked these guns for two reasons: they were slow so there
was a lot of dead time during action, and more importantly it&apos;s usually super
hard to hit moving targets with them. but i have to admit: hitting someone with
such projectile is very satisfying. but still, in total: not fun. at least that
was my opinion until i played shootmania which i think did something genius.
</p>

<p>
before explaining that, let&apos;s talk about the concept of ammo a little bit. ammo
adds a tactical dimension to a game. the amount of ammo you have changes your
tactic. full ammo? go guns blazing. low on ammo? play it very carefully, try to
eliminate enemies one by one with precision attacks. it also paces the game a
little bit. it forces you to explore the map for the resources. so it prevents
the game from being all action. in modern games you even have reloading, which
forces you to take mini-breaks from the action which helps you take a breath and
perhaps rethink your strategy. it&apos;s also a nice ritual you do after each battle.
it also helps to add a closure to a battle since you probably won&apos;t reload
during a battle unless you absolutely must. you do it when you feel your job is
done. i believe there might be also another psychological aspect of being more
vulnerable during a reload which also satisfies some internal craving of being
defenseless in a safe environment but i haven&apos;t thought about this aspect a lot
so let&apos;s not get into this.
</p>

<p>
the problem i have with ammo is that they take away from the purity of the game.
it makes the players inequal. the person with more ammo is at an advantage. so
at this point the game is not pure shooting skill, but also map control tactics.
both shootmania and mass effect solved this very nicely while still retaining
some of the above mentioned benefits: just have infinite, slowly recharging
ammo. in shootmania you have a single gun: a gun that shoots projectiles. but it
has a catch compared to the above games: there&apos;s no splash damage, you have to
hit the other player to frag them. that in itself would make it super hard but
to counteract this problem, you can shoot the gun as fast as you can. so you can
spray your enemy with projectiles. but that in itself would make it like a
tracer gun so to counteract that, you have only 3 shots in the gun. but they
quickly recharge, so even if you shoot away all your charges simultaneously, few
seconds later you can shoot again. however if you shoot as soon as your first
charge is ready, you&apos;ll need to wait again for your next shot. so what happens
often in close battles is that you have two players dancing around each other,
waiting for the right time to start attacking. too soon - they will have less
charges available - less chance of hitting the enemy. if they wait too long, the
enemy might start spray attacking sooner giving them a high chance for defeating
the player. and there&apos;s no unnatural need to run away from a battle due to lack
of ammo. the only thing the player needs to concentrate on is the other player
and the timing. it&apos;s as pure skill as possible.
</p>

<p>
so that&apos;s one aspect of gameplay. the other aspect is that you have a projectile
gun which means it&apos;s incredibly satisfying when you hit the other person. with a
typical hitscan weapon you just need to move the cursor over the other person&apos;s
avatar and shoot. it&apos;s a very mechanical skill that requires very good reflexes.
with projectiles you don&apos;t need to do that. all you need to do is to predict
where the enemy will be in a few seconds in the future. the nice thing about
this is, that you can compensate for bad reflexes simply by increasing your
distance to the enemy and making better predictions. and it&apos;s not like your
predictions must be absolutely perfect. the projectile balls are quite sizeable
so you have quite reasonable margin of error. and since you can spray 3 shots in
a row, you can cover a larger area. or even shoot tactically - use the first
projectile to make the enemy go down a certain path where you&apos;ll greet them with
your second projectile.
</p>

<p>
to summarize: i think a fast shooting projectile gun with limited but recharging
ammunition is the best gun to make a pure skill based bare bones shooter.
</p>

<p>
alright, we got the weapon down. next up is health. in general i think the
concept of health is silly. especially recharging health. if you have the
concept of health, then you start worrying about health. that takes away from
the pure shooting skill. i think the best thing to do is just to have instant
death. if you hit the enemy, the enemy dies. if the enemy hits you, you die.
shootmania actually gives you 2-3 lives so the first shot doesn&apos;t kill you
except for certain gamemodes. i think that&apos;s fine too up to a point. but if i
have to be as pure as possible and choose one gamemode, i&apos;d go with one hit one
kill. my motivation here is to simply not allow place for mistakes. if you win a
level then you should win it without any mistakes. that way you will feel the
best about yourself, that&apos;s how it should maximise the feeling of achievement.
</p>

<p>
keep in mind that i&apos;d play this game on doom 2 maps. they are relatively quite
small and if you don&apos;t hunt for resources, you can pretty much run through them
quite fast. so you wouldn&apos;t need checkpoints or savegame support. the game would
be only about the fact whether you can run through the map without a mistake or
not. the main challenge would be about you avoiding the enemy attacks until you
either manage to run past them or eliminate them based on your preferences. you
make a mistake, you quickly start from beginning and you keep trying until you
can do the level without a mistake. no messing with healths and lives and
whatnot. just pure movement and shooting.
</p>

<p>
and now come the enemies. i&apos;d represent the enemies as spheres. the projectiles
are also spheres so the collision detection becomes quite easy if you only have
the spheres to spheres case and spheres to a static geometry. and drawing them
is quite easy too: all you need to draw is a quad with a special shader that can
correctly project a spherical texture to that quad with a 3d effect. you don&apos;t
really need full human-like geometry to make the shooter fun. you usually need 3
pieces of information about an enemy:
</p>

<ul><li>
  position of the enemy,
</li><li>
  the direction of the enemy&apos;s movement,
</li><li>
  the intent of the enemy.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the position is quite easy to solve: the enemies have a face. you know the enemy
is facing towards you if you see their face. you just need to map the texture
correctly.
</p>

<p>
you can implement the intent easily too: you just draw a different face for
different action. e.g. if the enemy is preparing to shoot you, you could have a
texture where one of their eyes is closed and they are squinting. of if they
want to dodge, you just draw a big open mouth suggesting they are taking in air
for the jump and have their eyes look into the direction of they planned dodge.
</p>

<p>
the direction of movement is a bit trickier since you can&apos;t represent that with
texture tricks. you need two things: you need to implement &quot;bobbing&quot; during the
movement. basically the sphere should move slightly up and down to indicate the
movement. this is important because if they are moving towards or away from you,
this would be your primary hint. secondly, you need to implement a &quot;footsteps&quot;
like effect. basically every half a second add a quickly fading smoke effect in
their position at the given time. the point is that you should be able to see
the trail of their recent movement. this and the bobbing should be more than
enough indication of the direction. although the technique is relatively simple,
it needs a lot of finesse to get it right for maximum utility.
</p>

<p>
as for enemies, i wouldn&apos;t go overboard either. i&apos;d implement only 3 enemies:
</p>

<ul><li>
  biter
</li><li>
  diver
</li><li>
  spitter
</li>
</ul>

<p>
all three enemies would be quite mobile. if you shoot towards them, they will
try to dodge the projectile. so you actually need to get close to them to battle
with them. the game would be about close to mid range combat. of course that
doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t land the occasional lucky shot but it should be rare (but
incredibly satisfying). and of course the enemies have only one health too, so
the challenge is all about hitting them while avoiding their attacks. as for
differentiating the enemies: i&apos;d just probably color their spheres differently
and that&apos;s it.
</p>

<p>
biters are enemies that try to run towards you, jump on you and then bite your
head off. they are quite easy to deal with as long as you don&apos;t let them get too
close. if you do, you have to very carefully dodge their jumps.
</p>

<p>
divers are flying enemies that fly near you and once close, they dive towards
you. very similar to biters the only difference is that they are not constrained
to the floor. some doom levels have flying enemies, and having some vertical
enemies adds some extra flavor to the game anyways.
</p>

<p>
spitters also run towards you until they get to a mid range, and then they shoot
projectiles at you. they should be the closest that come to playing against
other players. and your projectile avoiding techniques must be top notch to
avoid their attacks. they should be able to predict your movements via simple
linear interpolation and thus you can&apos;t simply run around to avoid attacks, you
would need to move in a completely inpredictable way (which i often struggle
with). they can&apos;t spray projectiles like you can do, but if there are multiple
ones, that means a lot of projectiles to avoid.
</p>

<p>
in general i wouldn&apos;t put too many enemies on the map since you only have one
health. too many enemies would just a grind anyways. maybe about 3-7 enemies per
room depending on the size of the current room. that should provide plenty of
spatial challenge in avoiding the attacks, and a tactical challenge in shooting
them all quickly enough.
</p>

<p>
so that pretty much sums it up. i know one could extend this with gazillions of
stuff. but if i were to make a basic game, i would totally start with only that.
i think the above should be more than possible to finish someone in a few months
from total scratch in c and yet still end up with a quite nice game that doesn&apos;t
need a lot of polish.
</p>

<h2 id="talking">talking</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a game to learn some secrets about others.</p>
<p>
suppose you have a friend or three. i like to imagine such hypothetical
scenarios. and further imagine that you throw or are invited to a small party
with them. what do you really do there? i don&apos;t really like music, dancing,
drinking and such. i&apos;m more of a sit in the quiet corner and listen to other
people sort of person. maybe play some game. but what game?
</p>

<p>
ideally it will be a game that isn&apos;t too complex and doesn&apos;t really require too
many props. i very quickly lose interest in games with many rules. and even if
you can follow them all, what&apos;s the point in playing such a game? i feel it&apos;s
just killing time. if i am already with people, i&apos;d want a game that focuses on
the people instead. it should make it possible for me to learn more about others
to see what people they really are. so basically i just want some structured
talking instead and the &quot;game&quot; could provide the structure.
</p>

<p>
one popular simple party game is cards against humanity. there is a list of
cards with questions on it, face down. each turn a player (called the czar)
turns a question card up and people have to come up with a witty answer to it.
each player has 10 cards with pre-written answer cards from which they can
choose from. or one could play this even without pre-written answers and rely on
people&apos;s inner creativity to come up with witty answers. the person who turned
up the question card has to pick the wittiest response. the owner of that
response wins the round. the answer cards should be shuffled before the czar
evaluates to avoid biased selection. this would be harder in the handwritten,
artisan answers but one could solve that by writing the responses on a
smartphone.
</p>

<p>
this is quite a fun game, potentially leading to fun times. the downside is that
you don&apos;t learn much from the other people, only their wittiness. so i was
looking for other similar games with more focus on the people themselves. and i
found some! and the rules are even simpler. i found two games and they go with
the names of &quot;disturbing friends&quot; and &quot;voting game&quot; and sort of came up with my
own rules based on the ideas behind these games.
</p>

<p>
the first game has question cards which contain a question and 2 to 4 answers. a
player, the round&apos;s czar, turns up a question card. the other players have to
guess how the czar will answer the question. the czar must try to answer the
question as honestly as they can. often there are no correct answers. in such
case the czar must pick the answer closest to their heart. each player has some
voting cards each with a number from 1 to 4. every player has to pick their
answer and put the corresponding voting card in front of them, face down. once
each player has voted, people reveal their vote one by one and finally the czar
reveals their answer. the czar wins (or loses depending on perspective) the
round if half or more of people didn&apos;t guess the answer correctly.
</p>

<p>
depending on the questions this can be quite fun with unexpected twists. you can
have a neutral question like &quot;best pet: cat/dog/fish&quot; and learn what animal the
czar likes. the czar also learns what other people&apos;s impressions of him are. you
can have a more politically motivated question like &quot;gun ownership: yes to
all/only license/banned completely&quot; to learn how people think politically. or
you can have a question like &quot;polyamory: it&apos;s a bad idea/ok but not for me/i am
polyamorous&quot; to learn other people&apos;s inclinations. the nice thing here is that
the game brings up the question, you don&apos;t really have to awkwardly bring it up
yourself in case you are curious about people&apos;s opinions on a topic. or you can
have a dirty nsfw question like &quot;my crotch has (select first that apply):
jewelry/tattoo/other surprise&quot;. this is where the unexpected twists can occur:
maybe some people get intrigued by the czar&apos;s answer and then the czar flashes
their body to the party. that certainly could result in a lot of fun from then
on!
</p>

<p>
the ideal number of people for this game is about 4 so that the czar can see the
opinion of 3 people which is not too little, nor too much. but i think a couple
or a pair of people could also play this game. in such case the goal remains to
guess the other person&apos;s answer and see how well the two people know each other
and learn more about each other.
</p>

<p>
the other game is a bit simpler because it doesn&apos;t have a czar. you don&apos;t have
questions here but rather statements. each person gets assigned a distinct
number from 1 to n before the game starts. each round the group turns up a
statement card. people then have to vote which person is best described by the
statement. the round is won (or lost depending on perspective) by the person
acquiring the most votes. if there is a tie, people can break that verbally by
arguing who should be the winner.
</p>

<p>
(edit: or one can simply get a point whenever they correctly guessed an answer.
the person with the most points is the person who knows their friends the best.)
</p>

<p>
a neutral question could be something like &quot;... cooks the best&quot;. people can then
see whose cooking they find the best. a more interesting one could be &quot;... can
hold their breath the longest&quot;. people might contest the result of the vote and
a fun breath holding contest might start. a nsfw statement might be &quot;... wants
to hang around naked&quot;. people then could then ask the winner &quot;do you really want
to be naked&quot; and maybe the party pivots into a fun naked party!
</p>

<p>
this game is probably best played with 5 people so that there are less chances
for ties. but i think this one could be played by a couple too. the couple just
decides between each other who wins each statement.
</p>

<p>
in order to play this game, one needs voting cards. one solution is to take
postit notes and write some numbers on them. the other solution is to cut up an
a4 paper into small slips and write some number on them. or even less effort
would be to find some coins or other small items. when you want to vote for 3,
you put 3 coins into your hand under the table and then show your hand when your
time comes. one doesn&apos;t need elaborate equipment or boards to play these games.
</p>

<p>
there could be some punishment or reward for the losers and winners each round.
ideas:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the losers have to make 5 pushups or squats each time,
</li><li>
  the winners can consume something of their preference,
</li><li>
  they need to remove or acquire a piece of clothing,
</li><li>
  they choose the background music for the next round,
</li><li>
  others can draw funny stuff on their faces or body,
</li><li>
  they need to be standing for the next round.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it doesn&apos;t really matter much what it is but if there&apos;s some form of feedback
then that raises the stakes a bit and makes the game a bit more interesting. the
party members much agree on this beforehand so that everybody is comfortable
with the punishments.
</p>

<p>
one could print the question and statement cards but i don&apos;t think it&apos;s
necessary. as long as one has an app loaded with bunch of questions, one could
just use a smartphone to present the questions. ideally people should source
their own questions. nevertheless i decided to collect some sample questions and
statements and make a small tool for it that is convenient to use from a
smartphone. i even separated out the nsfw stuff so you can even play this in a
family friendly setting. but a warning: the nsfw stuff is quite strong, i
believe. only enable it with friends you absolutely trust no matter what happens
or people you don&apos;t know at all so that there are less stakes in the manner. if
in doubt, just look up the list of questions in the source of the webpage before
playing the game. the webpage has no dependencies so feel free to copy it
somewhere and edit the list of questions in it, e.g. remove the potentially
offending ones and add your topics of interest. you can find my tool here:
</p>

<ul><li>
  https://notech.ie/cards
</li>
</ul>

<p>
load that on a smartphone, select your list and put it into the middle of the
table and keep pressing next as the rounds progress. it has about 30 cards for
each type. if you ever try it then let me know how it went. i never tried this
so caveat emptor. maybe i&apos;ll have the chance to try this one day (with the nsfw
stuff included) and then i can improve it or list more tips here.
</p>

<p>
edit: btw, i found a similar site with multiple games along the same ideas.
it&apos;s here: https://psycatgames.com/
</p>

<p>
edit2: btw, if you are looking for a name for these sort of games,
i&apos;d go with &quot;frivia&quot; as in &quot;friend trivia&quot;.
it&apos;s a trivia about friends after all.
let me know if there&apos;s a better or more popular name for these things.
</p>

<h2 id="touch">touch</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a touching game.</p>
<p>
i&apos;m quite a reserved person. it&apos;s quite hard for me to verbally express my
wishes. i often don&apos;t even know what i want. and when i do, then i worry that if
i express it to the other person, they will get offended about me and it just
ruins the relationship. i&apos;m always on the lookout for things that make human
interactions a little bit easier.
</p>

<p>
i like receiving and giving touch quite much. but people have very diverse
preferences about what is an okay touch and what is not. so i tend to err on the
conservative side and just keep to myself. otherwise i&apos;d need to communicate
with people. fortunately i found a very nice but very simple game that can free
up people from all the worries when it comes to touch. and you can play this
with any willing person. it&apos;s called the &quot;3 minute game&quot; and was popularized by
betty martin.
</p>

<p>
first, let&apos;s talk about some aspects of the &quot;wheel of consent&quot;, or a simplified
version of it. each act a human does can be categorized into one of the
following 4 dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  giving: i&apos;m doing something to someone for their benefit
</li><li>
  receiving: someone does something to me for my own benefit
</li><li>
  taking: i&apos;m doing something to someone for my own benefit
</li><li>
  allowing: someone does something to me for their benefit
</li>
</ul>

<p>
they complement each other. when person a is giving to b, then b is receiving.
if person a is taking from b, person b is allowing. you can draw this in a fancy
circle, that&apos;s where the name &quot;wheel of consent&quot; comes from.
</p>

<p>
how much giving, receiving, taking, allowing a person does, matters. each person
has a healthy limit for each dimension. going over we get to the &quot;shadow sides&quot;
of the dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much giving: martyr, self sacrificer
</li><li>
  too much receiving: freeloader, entitled
</li><li>
  too much taking: raper, stealer
</li><li>
  too much allowing: pushover, endurer
</li>
</ul>

<p>
you want to ensure that every act for everyone involved remains in the inner,
non-shadow side of the dimensions.
</p>

<p>
next up, you really need to understand which dimension each act is in for each
person involved. suppose you regularly do an activity (e.g. foot massage). you
think you are doing it as a favor for person b so you are in the giving
dimension. for the other person that activity is in the allowing dimension. they
let you do it because they think you like doing it. but giving and allowing are
not complementary dimensions. it turns out nobody really wants that activity yet
none of the people involved realize this. this is basically a variant of the
abilene paradox. there&apos;s also the flipside to this: you often don&apos;t do some acts
because you think the other person wouldn&apos;t like it. however it might be the
case they would allow you to experiment with it. but you don&apos;t even ask because
of the fear of rejection.
</p>

<p>
the &quot;3 minute game&quot; is a short game that helps you structure communication along
those 4 dimensions. it helps you do activities where it is super clear who it is
for. it consists of four 3 minute rounds. in round 1 player a asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like me to touch you for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person a will be doing something to person b for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective the activity is giving, from
person b&apos;s perspective it is a receiving activity. keep in mind that person a
shouldn&apos;t sink to the shadow sides of their dimension, they should only do what
they are comfortable to give to the other person. in other words they have to
consent to the act. if person a is not happy with the arrangement, they might
negotiate a little bit what their limits are and then agree on that. on the
flipside person b might just want a boring neck massage. it doesn&apos;t have to
sexual all the time. person a has to accept that in this round it&apos;s all about
person b&apos;s wishes. once everybody is happy agreed on the activity, person a does
the agreed on touch for 3 minutes. then person b thanks for person a for this.
</p>

<p>
in round 2, player a again asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like to touch me for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person b will be doing something to person a for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective this is allowing, while from
person b&apos;s perspective this is taking. the same negotiation and consent process
happens just as before. person b might be very horny and might want to crazy
stuff. person a must realize that this is fine to express and that they don&apos;t
have to succumb to the shadow side, they can refuse and person b shall respect
that otherwise they are succumbing to the shadow side. once agreed, person b
does the activity for 3 minutes. again, since this was for person b&apos;s benefit,
person b thanks person a for the act.
</p>

<p>
round 3 and 4 is the same as round 1 and 2 but with the other person asking the
questions. the whole thing takes about 15 minutes and is worth every minute of
it.
</p>

<p>
this game might sound a little bit silly at first. but what makes it truly
remarkable is that it makes you stop for a minute and think. the question might
initially look simple enough but answering them often is quite hard. it&apos;s very
rare that we get a question on what we want. often i don&apos;t even know what sort
of touch i really want but this lets me think deep on what sort of thing would
fill me up now the best. and i can be very selfish in these thoughts, i don&apos;t
need to play an internal chess to ensure whatever i want is something compatible
with my partner. or that if i ask for this particular thing then my relationship
would spoil a bit. the flipside is true too: my partner can think of anything.
even if i don&apos;t really like the requested activity, i&apos;m certainly willing to
give it 3 minutes, whatever it is. it can be a really freeing sensation once you
experience this game in a safe and supportive environment. you feel like you can
ask for anything and not be judged. you can say anything you want. i haven&apos;t
really tried it in a non-sexual environment so i don&apos;t know how well it works
there but i&apos;d suspect it should hold up quite well there as well. you can see
sample sessions from such environment in betty&apos;s original videos and you can
see the participants happy with the game. betty&apos;s videos are well worth a watch.
</p>

<p>
in the original documentation of this game, betty mentions that this is a game
for 2 or more people. the &quot;or more&quot; version is quite intriguing to me. she
didn&apos;t really explain that part as far as i remember. i&apos;m not entirely sure how
that would work. e.g. how could 3 people play this game? i think what you can do
is that rather than a single person asking the questions, 2 people ask the
questions together to the 3rd person. the third person then can come up with
activities that involve the first two people doing something to the third and
only proceed with the act if everyone agrees to it without succumbing to the
shadow sides. i guess that&apos;s how the &quot;or more&quot; works: each round a selected
person has to ask the group for something they can do together for the selected
person&apos;s benefit. it probably scales okay to 4 people but afterwards i&apos;d imagine
it has way too much communication overhead. never tried this though so not sure
how transformative experience the group setting is yet.
</p>

<p>
the wheel of consent itself is a quite generic concept. it can apply in other
cases as well, not just the above game. e.g. you get invited to a party. do you
go or not? who benefits from you going to the party? it is an interesting
viewpoint to see our activities from. and things can get complicated: you only
benefit from the party if some other person also goes. and that other person
only benefits if you go. now you have these complex, conditional scenarios that
i can&apos;t really wrap my head around yet, so i&apos;ll not dig into this aspect. i&apos;m
just trying to popularize this wheel of consent concept because looks like it&apos;s
a useful framework to work with.
</p>

<p>
if you ever try this game then let me know how it went and what your experiences
with it were.
</p>

<h2 id="sembr">sembr</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>use semantic linebreaks for plaintext.</p>
<ul><li>
  semantic linebreaks is an old idea where you put newlines after thought ends.
</li><li>
  basically a newline after the periods or thought joining commas.
</li><li>
  i&apos;m using lists here to better showcase
  how this could look like if well presented.
</li><li>
  previously i used to format my plaintext to 80 characters.
</li><li>
  i never really liked the &quot;write a paragraph per line&quot; style of editing.
</li><li>
  now i think semantic linebreaks are superior to 80 character wrapping.
</li><li>
  first, it has many technological advantages.
</li><li>
  you don&apos;t have to reformat your lines after each edit.
</li><li>
  that takes out a lot of churn out of this old style text editing.
</li><li>
  making edits with a line oriented editor like vim also gets easier.
</li><li>
  it&apos;s super easy to shuffle text around, or just rewrite small parts.
</li><li>
  such edits look much simpler in text diffing tools too.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  then there&apos;s the other, emotional aspect of it.
</li><li>
  now keep in mind, that i still limit myself to 80 characters per line.
</li><li>
  with sembreaks this means that all my thoughts must fit 80 characters.
</li><li>
  i still permit separate clauses to spill onto separate lines though.
</li><li>
  i used this style for a few weeks now in personal writing.
</li><li>
  it does feel that it makes my sentencer simpler, perhaps more childish.
</li><li>
  but i feel more clarity out of them.
</li><li>
  this way i must find the beginning and the end of each thought.
</li><li>
  each thought must be short and must stand on its own.
</li><li>
  i can&apos;t drone on and on without saying anything.
</li><li>
  i feel that this creative limitation helps me to think.
</li><li>
  it forces me to break down those swirling thoughts into digestible pieces.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  i think, though not sure how to show, but this makes reading easier too.
</li><li>
  think of the process of programming.
</li><li>
  we also put all the statements onto their own, separate lines.
</li><li>
  it would look weird if you would format code to 80 characters.
</li><li>
  it just feels cleaner when done this way.
</li><li>
  so why wouldn&apos;t we want this extra clarity from ordinary text too?
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  this method does make text use up more vertical space.
</li><li>
  in some cases this can be a disadvantage.
</li><li>
  perhaps in the ancient times the paper was expensive.
</li><li>
  or people don&apos;t like overly thick books.
</li><li>
  but on computer screen i think the extra height is not an issue.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  i tried to convert ordinary text into sembreak&apos;d style with this script:
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
  document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/[:;.?!,] /g, &apos;$&amp;&lt;br&gt;&apos;)
</pre>

<ul><li>
  it didn&apos;t work.
</li><li>
  if something wasn&apos;t written with the 80 character / thought limit,
  then sembreaks won&apos;t make it easier to read.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  it also initally makes the text to look like poetry.
</li><li>
  it adds some rythm to the text and it feels a little bit weird to read.
</li><li>
  search for &quot;ventilated prose&quot; and see the discussion around this.
</li><li>
  with that search term you&apos;ll see so other examples of this style.
</li><li>
  but i see that a lot of examples are splitting mid-thought.
</li><li>
  they use super narrow margins.
</li><li>
  they never really recommend a specific character limit.
</li><li>
  they let people go with their gut feelings of what is long.
</li><li>
  i don&apos;t really like this approach, i prefer static limits.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  there&apos;s also a lot of discussion about how manual wrapping is 70-ies tech.
</li><li>
  that this day and age we should just write full paragraphs per line.
</li><li>
  i don&apos;t really have a good argument against this.
</li><li>
  if people don&apos;t mind relying on fancy text editors for text editing,
</li><li>
  then they should go for it.
</li><li>
  i&apos;m old school, and i like relying on less tech to do simple things.
</li><li>
  hence i wrap manually and now semantically.
</li><li>
  besides, if you write markdown or html, the renderers will reformat anyways.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>
  i started writing my personal emails with this style.
</li><li>
  my emails are always plaintext.
</li><li>
  looks like nobody was bothered enough to complain about this style.
</li><li>
  maybe people don&apos;t mind reading text like this.
</li><li>
  i&apos;m now trying to write my work emails like this too and see how it goes.
</li><li>
  maybe the idea catches on eventually.
</li><li>
  maybe someone else will start communicating with me with this style.

  then, hopefully, i&apos;ll be able to tell if it really makes things nicer or not.

  for now i&apos;ll just keep the solo experiment going.

<p style=font-weight:bold>a barebones way to replace your webcam feed with a talking avatar.</p>
<p>
i keep my work laptop under my desk.
i plug an external monitor, keyboard, mouse into it.
i basically use it as a workstation.
therefore its builtin webcam and microphone are not really accessible to me.
these days i use a smartphone for the meetings.
i was wondering,
could i still use my laptop and just present a nice avatar on meetings?
</p>

<p>
an avatar that would stand still if i wasn&apos;t doing active.
but it would talk if i talked.
or it would be nodding yes or no if i wanted to be nodding.
nothing fancy, but streaming simple, manually controlled, precanned animations.
</p>

<p>
if you are a sensible person, you would use obs studio for this.
but obviously i&apos;m too cheapskate to install and learn new free software.
so i decided to find my own ways to solve this problem.
the information here is absolutely of no use for anyone (if not harmful),
i just thought i document it for my own future reference.
(so that i have more content to facepalm myself about when i get old.)
</p>

<p>
i chose phoenix wright from the ace attorney game as my virtual avatar.
it&apos;s about an attorney who must solve crimes right in the courtroom.
his iconic move is saying &quot;objection&quot; whenever he hears a contradiction.
it&apos;s a gameboy game and i found gif rips online.
i found 9 animations i liked:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. just standing (and occasionally blinking)
</li><li>
  2. normal talking (this is what i&apos;d use when i talk)
</li><li>
  3. determined talking (he leans in as he talks)
</li><li>
  4. thinking pose
</li><li>
  5. talking in the thinking pose
</li><li>
  6. ashamed talking
</li><li>
  7. nodding yes
</li><li>
  8. nodding no
</li><li>
  9. despair pose
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it doesn&apos;t have to be anime characters.
one could prerecord short loops of themselves too.
the point is that i have 9 mpg files called 1.mpg ... 9.mpg,
and that all these animations can be looped.
i want a little interface where i can choose the currently looping animation.
</p>

<p>
since the original art was gifs, i converted them into mpg files like this:
</p>

<pre>
  ffmpeg -re -i phoenix/anim008.gif -map 0:v -pix_fmt yuv420p \
    -filter:v crop=960:540:0:0 3.mpg
</pre>

<p>
then i needed a virtual webcam to stream these gifs into.
i created one like this:
</p>

<pre>
  modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1
</pre>

<p>
now comes the tricky part.
it&apos;s pretty easy to stream a particular video into such a virtual webcam.
however what i want here is a little control box,
with which i can dynamically change what i stream into the webcam.
one obvious idea is to have ffmpeg loop a video statically into the webcam.
whenever i want to change the animation,
i kill the current ffmpeg and start a new one with the new animation.
this felt unclean.
and sometimes it messed up the virtual webcam.
it was flaky due to unclean exits, i presume.
i needed a saner solution.
preferably something that doesn&apos;t really require me to code up anything.
i found a very ugly hack which allowed me to do this.
</p>

<p>
ffmpeg has a feature where you can tell it to load a list of files from a file.
it can then concatenate those files and loop them.
so i created a simple loop.txt containing these two files:
</p>

<pre>
  file a.mpg
  file b.mpg
</pre>

<p>
i instruct ffmpeg to loop concatenating these two files.
in order to switch animation,
i just replace these files with the new animation.
yes, i need two separate files.
otherwise ffmpeg doesn&apos;t reopen the file.
it would keep playing the old animation even if i overwrote the underlying file.
i guess this makes sense from an optimization perspective.
</p>

<p>
so then i just wrote a script that reads digits and rewrites files in a loop.
i had one extra requirement though.
my animation selection console is running in a terminal.
the vidconf software is running in a browser.
i wanted to be able to mute and unmute straight from the terminal script.
so for that i used xdotool.
whenever i press the 0 key i do this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. focus the browser,
</li><li>
  2. send the mute/unmute keybinding,
</li><li>
  3. focus back the terminal.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
ugh, i know.
for reference here&apos;s the full bash monstrosity:
</p>

<pre>
  #!/bin/bash
  echo select the browser window with the vidconf.
  current=$(xdotool getactivewindow)
  browser=$(xdotool selectwindow)
  echo
  
  # remind myself of my options.
  echo &apos;1watch        2talk         3determined&apos;
  echo &apos;4thinking     5thinktalk    6ashamedtalk&apos;
  echo &apos;7yes          8no           9despair&apos;
  
  # set the inital, standing only animation.
  cp 1.mpg a.mpg
  cp 1.mpg b.mpg
  # start the endless ffmpeg stream.
  ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stream_loop -1 -re -f concat -i loop.txt -map 0:v \
    -f v4l2 -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -filter:v crop=960:540:0:0 \
    /dev/video2 &amp;
  # read the requested animation from the keyboard.
  while read -sn1 choice; do
    if ! [[ &quot;$choice&quot; =~ ^[0-9]$ ]]; then
      continue
    fi
    if test &quot;$choice&quot; == 0; then
      # mute or unmute.
      xdotool windowactivate --sync &quot;$browser&quot;
      xdotool key ctrl+d
      xdotool windowactivate &quot;$current&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null
      continue;
    fi
    # set the newly desired animation.
    cp $choice.mpg tmp
    mv tmp a.mpg
    cp $choice.mpg tmp
    mv tmp b.mpg
  done
</pre>

<p>
it&apos;s a terrible way to do this but it works okay.
i&apos;m pretty sure the gazillion ways to do this better.
the main limitation is that it can only switch to the next animation,
when the current animation has finished.
so it only works with short animations.
but that was the case for me so that wasn&apos;t a big deal.
i don&apos;t really use this thing often though,
but sounded like a fun enough solution to share.
</p>

<h2 id="pens">pens</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a review of the pens i use and like.</p>
<p>
i quite like to write on paper.
it just feels oddly satisfying to draw letters nicely.
if there&apos;s no time pressure,
then i prefer writing on paper to writing on the computer.
sometimes i even write my emails or blog posts in my notebook first.
but most of the time i write just to think.
simply writing down my thoughts often cuts my mental deadlocks.
circular or obsessive thoughts are very easy to spot in writing.
and if you spot them, it&apos;s much easier to avoid them.
so as long as i &quot;think&quot; via writing, my &quot;thinking&quot; is more effective.
</p>

<p>
anyways, writing requires pens, and i just wanted to note my preferences.
maybe the world will make more pens like them thanks to this post, who knows.
i didn&apos;t give pens much thought for a long time.
i just thought all of them are crappy
until i learned that there are nice ones too.
it was during my 2nd year in university,
when a freshman roommate showed me his pen.
it was a uniball 0.38 signo dx (um-151).
i really liked how thin the writing was.
i started using one.
the ink was fast drying too,
so i had much less smudging,
and my hands stopped being all ink all the time.
i then ordered a box of 0.28 ones straight from america.
that was a very wise decision.
those pens lasted my whole university time.
</p>

<p>
the reason i like fine lines is because i use relatively small letters.
i&apos;m quite myopic, about -5d (and worsening).
that means i see clearly only up to 20cm.
so i keep my head bove the paper about that distance.
small letters let me have enough space in a small area.
and for small letters i really need a fine pen.
</p>

<p>
now i live in switzerland and those signo dx pens are hard to come by.
so now i&apos;m testing the sakura pigma microns.
i only started using them a few weeks ago.
it was a bit weird initially since it is a plastic needle tip pen.
i didn&apos;t use such a pen before.
but they feel super nice to write with.
they are not super thin though.
even the smallest, 0.05 version feels about the same as the 0.38 signo dx.
side note: some pens report the nib size, others report the resulting line size.
no idea why they can&apos;t all use the same measurement to number their pens.
</p>

<p>
the only annoying thing about the pigma micron is that it is brittle.
the problem is that its tip slowly goes back inside its metal frame.
perhaps i&apos;m using way too much pressure while writing.
after a while it becomes very inconvenient or unable to write,
even though there&apos;s plenty of ink remaining.
and it&apos;s not something that can be easily repaired.
or at least i&apos;m not skilled enough to repair such a fine instrument.
if these pens wouldn&apos;t have this flaw,
i&apos;d be happy to use them instead of the signo dx pens.
but if i have to choose,
i think i&apos;d still stick with the 0.28 signo dx pens.
another advantage of the signo dx pens is,
that you can clearly see the amount of the remaining ink.
the pigma microns lack this feature.
not that i ever managed to write one dry.
</p>

<p>
btw, i understand not everyone likes small letters or fine lines.
if i were to write something for others to read,
i might use bigger letters and thicker pens.
i recently tried the uniball eye micro (ub-150).
it is quite thick, but also very nice to write with.
i&apos;d probably use that one for such writing (or a thicker pigma micron).
</p>

<p>
as for paper, i use a spiraled a5 graph ruled notebook.
the grid is really helpful in nicely aligning my text or sometimes a drawing.
i don&apos;t really like to use a completely clean paper.
i don&apos;t think i have a preference about paper weight.
if the paper is smooth and the ink doesn&apos;t bleed to the other side, i&apos;m happy.
</p>

<p>
so i like to handwrite.
do i like reading other people&apos;s handwriting?
hell no!
most people simply can&apos;t write readably.
i even seen people who have very &quot;aesthetically&quot; looking writing,
but it was still unreadable to me.
during school some people did sometimes note that my writing is a bit ugly,
but at the same time it was super rare that someone asked for a clarification.
so even if my writing is ugly, at least it&apos;s somewhat readable.
that&apos;s the important part.
i guess people just don&apos;t really care about readability these modern times.
handwriting is a lost art.
btw, if curious about my handwriting, i took a photo of a page of my writing.
it&apos;s at /pens.jpg.
this one is quite ugly though.
i usually write much nicer if i expect others to read it.
i didn&apos;t know i&apos;ll take a photo back then, so i didn&apos;t spend effort on niceness.
at least you can see my ugly side.
in any case, i wouldn&apos;t really want to communicate via handwriting.
i prefer reading nicely printed text instead (if short then screen is fine too).
</p>

<p>
btw, one disclaimer to these preferences:
i&apos;m no big pen guru.
i haven&apos;t tried many pens.
so i constructed my preferences from a small sample size.
if anyone knows cheap, available pens i&apos;d like, then let me know.
</p>

<p>
anyways, to summarize,
my favorite pens are (in this order, assuming their finest version):
</p>

<ul><li>
  uniball signo dx (um-151)
</li><li>
  sakura pigma micron
</li><li>
  uniball eye micro (ub-150)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
edit: not long after writing this post, i had an idea.
i realized that i found it quite uncomfortable
to write on the left side of the notebook.
my wrist rested on the spiral.
and it was really annoying whenever i had to write near the right margin.
the spiral was getting in the way of the pen.
so i decided that from now on i&apos;ll just flip the notebook for the left side.
so every time i start a new page, i have to flip the notebook.
or more specifically: rotate the notebook 180 degrees.
/pens.jpg shows the old style.
in the new style i&apos;d have flipped the notebook.
the sentences would always start at the spiral, no matter where i write.
this would be annoying if i wanted to read the notebook,
but for me it&apos;s mostly write only.
the reading inconvenience of the flipping is worth the writing convenience.
i&apos;ll totally do this from now and see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
edit2: i came across the muji 0.38mm gel pens.
they are similar to the sigma dx but can be bought here in switzerland in muji.
muji is some sort of retailer for random japanese stuff, i think.
it&apos;s not perfect though.
i&apos;m not sure if i got a faulty unit or all of them are like this,
but the one i tried needed more pressure to ensure the ball is rolling.
if i didn&apos;t do that (with micros i use barely any) the ink just skipped.
but i could get used to this too.
it&apos;s a nice pen.
but after using the microns for a while, i might like them better than ballpens.
the &quot;needle goes back to its cave&quot; is the only thing that annoys me. :(
</p>

<p>
edit3: i no longer flip my notebook each time i fill a page.
what i do instead is that i simply skip the other side of the page.
this way i can always easily refer to the previous pages
and write at the same time though i don&apos;t usually refer back.
i only flip the notebook when i filled the right side of the notebook.
then i go backwards in the flipped notebook so i still write on the right side.
very convenient.
</p>

<h2 id="enacc">enacc</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a silly system for motivating physical exercise.</p>
<p>
i&apos;m quite the sucker for temptations and vices.
i&apos;ve managed to avoid the worst ones
and fortunately no vice takes up too much time from me on average.
but sometimes i have a flareup and then i tend to go overboard with things.
i decide to check out a manga, an anime or a game,
and then i&apos;m spending 10 hours per day consuming it up to several weeks.
i guess i have issues with moderation.
during those flareups this can really affect my general productivity.
in the past i had all sorts of addictions
but i managed to cure myself out of them.
i do that by avoiding the triggers and resisting the temptations.
but sometimes it takes quite a long time for me to enact countermeasures.
here&apos;s a random sampling of addictions i have or had in the past:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much time on reddit or hackernews,
</li><li>
  too much time gaming,
</li><li>
  eating too much junk food,
</li><li>
  reading too many blogs,
</li><li>
  watching too much youtube, anime, or movies,
</li><li>
  obsessively checking my email,
</li><li>
  fapping too much.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in moderation they are fine,
but when i go overboard, i often regret all the wasted time and energy.
i regret not spending the time on stuff i know i wouldn&apos;t regret.
here&apos;s a sampling of stuff after which i feel somewhat good:
</p>

<ul><li>
  finishing some work related tasks,
</li><li>
  writing a blog post, demo, game,
</li><li>
  exchanging emails with people,
</li><li>
  spending time with people i like.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if i have a flareup of one of the former activities,
these preferred activities get much less attention,
which means i don&apos;t feel very good about myself.
all of these good things require a lot of energy to start them,
and if the activation energy is too high,
i&apos;m more tempted to procrastinate with the former activities.
</p>

<p>
i was thinking what options i have to help myself.
one common tip against bad habits is to replace them with different habits.
that sort of works but it&apos;s quite hard.
and it doesn&apos;t really help with the flareups,
where you spend a lot of time in a short burst on an activity.
i want something that would force me to moderate myself
and works regardless of activity.
</p>

<p>
my sudden idea is to assign an &quot;energy cost&quot; for those regretful activities.
i then have a limited supply of energy and i have to budget it thoughtfully.
if i have a lot of energy saved, i can let myself have some fun.
if i&apos;m low on energy, i can only allow the simplest things like checking email.
this still allows me to do things in bursts (that&apos;s my preference),
but thanks to the tracking
i can now rely on the system that it will prevent me from going overboard.
</p>

<p>
what should be the source of this energy?
well, these days i spend all my days indoors thanks to the covid19 lockdowns.
i just sit all day long.
i don&apos;t get any exercise at all.
therefore i decided to gain energy from doing some simple exercises.
the goal isn&apos;t to get buffed from these exercises,
but to have less zero days.
zero day means a day where you didn&apos;t do anything useful.
the goal is to avoid them.
so i guess this little gamification could help me avoid them.
</p>

<p>
i started this system when i was writing this post,
and i felt that it already helped me to curb my email checking addiction.
i don&apos;t want to waste my hard earned energy points on this silly habit.
there&apos;s no need to check it more than a few times a day.
this allows me to focus better
and makes it actually possible to write this post.
one could say that i&apos;m actually quantifying my opportunity cost
and i&apos;m using my loss aversion tendency to battle the bad habits.
</p>

<p>
to make things harder, i track energy in multiple dimensions.
each exercise type i track gets its own dimension.
for example i can start with three dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  pushup: 1 pushup = 1 pushup energy
</li><li>
  pullup: 1 pullup = 2 pullup energy
</li><li>
  squat: 2 squats = 1 squat energy
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in this example different exercises convert to different amount of energy.
pullups are hard for me, so i&apos;d get more energy from a single pushup.
squats are relatively easy, so i&apos;d need to do more from it for a single point.
</p>

<p>
to use up some energy, i subtract that energy from all dimensions!
for example if i have pushup:7 pullup:6 squat:3 energy levels,
and checking on email costs 2 energy points,
then after that i&apos;d have pushup:5 pullup:4 squat:1 energy remaining.
i&apos;d need to do 2 squats again before i could check on my email again.
i subtract from all dimensions to ensure my exercises are somewhat balanced.
the goal of the system is to stay in the positive range
and rack up enough buffer
so that i can enjoy some of the bad activities when i feel down.
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s super easy to add and remove exercise dimensions as i see fit.
maybe i get some dumbbells and then i can add a dumbbell curls.
maybe some day i want to focus on being more outside.
then i can add an outside dimension
which will result in 2 energy points for every minute spent outside.
or if pushups become to easy,
i can just change my accounting so that i need 2 pushups for each energy point.
or maybe i break a leg bone, then i can remove tracking squat for a while.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about using exercises is
that after an exercise i feel more motivated to do sensible stuff.
exercise somehow wakes up my spirit.
so this system not only limits my bad habits,
but it also motivates me to spend time on my preferred activities.
and getting some exercise out of it is not a bad deal either.
i tried going to gym a while ago.
i&apos;ve lasted a couple months but i found it incredibly boring.
i felt that there was just no point to it.
but this system gives me some goal for the exercises.
i understand that these little exercises don&apos;t substitute real exercise.
however i&apos;m more likely to do it several times per day
which is good from a &quot;take a break from the computer&quot; perspective at least.
by the way, this style of training is called &quot;grease the groove&quot;,
although i&apos;m not taking this experiment seriously enough to call it a training.
</p>

<p>
i also have a lot of flexibility over costs too.
for example i can start with this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1 point for each minute of youtube, anime, tv watched or game played,
</li><li>
  2 points for checking on email,
</li><li>
  10 points for checking on memes or aggregators,
</li><li>
  10 points for eating some junk food.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the costs are arbitrary
and subject to constant tweaking based on how i feel about my habits.
in order for me to binge watch a long anime,
i have to buffer up a lot of energy.
which is good, because at least my body got something out of it.
and since i couldn&apos;t watch said anime until i buffered up enough energy,
i probably spent a lot of time on doing nice stuff in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t plan to use this as an excuse to restart my old bad habits.
i&apos;d still heavily avoid hackernews for example.
one visit to that site and my day is ruined.
it&apos;s more for protection against accidental visits or accidental new habits.
if i notice i started doing something that i regret afterwards,
i can quickly assign some cost to it and thus limit myself.
</p>

<p>
i also put an upper limit of 1000 points on the values in the dimensions.
for example that&apos;s about 16.5 hours of anime watching.
this way i can be certain
that i won&apos;t burn more than 2 days in a row just on a single anime.
the other function of the upper limit,
is to signal that an exercise is maybe too easy.
if i can easily reach 1000 in a dimension, maybe i should make it harder.
e.g. if i could easily make 1000 pushups in a few days (i wish),
i could change the accounting to have 2 pushups only mean 1 point.
or maybe i could pushups with a weighted vest.
</p>

<p>
although the system allows the energy levels to go below 0,
but i wouldn&apos;t allow that to happen (hopefully).
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s relatively easy to track this on pen and paper.
all you need is a table.
each row should have a timestamp (mmdd hhmm format to save space),
and the latest energy levels for each dimension.
suppose it&apos;s july 17 and you start with 10 energy points in each dimension,
check on the email, then do another 2 pushups, then watch a cat video next day.
your table would look like this:
</p>

<pre>
  timestamp | pushup | pullup | squat | comment
  ----------+--------+--------+-------+--------
  0717 0800 |     10 |     10 |    10 |
       0817 |      8 |      8 |     8 | email
       0820 |     10 |        |       |
  0718 0703 |      6 |      4 |     4 | 4min cat video
</pre>

<p>
the comment column is optional, i think i would leave it empty most of the time.
and if the level is the same as in the previous row, i can leave that empty too.
timestamp is also optional to track.
if you do it, you can then graph your energy levels over time.
even if you do that, tracking hour and minute might be overkill,
maybe just note the day and track only that.
</p>

<p>
in my case i spend almost all my time in front of the computer,
so obviously i made a script for myself to do this tracking.
i made a little &quot;enacc&quot; tool and it logs all my changes into the ~/.enacc file.
enacc stands for energy accounting tool.
i can write &quot;enacc 2&quot; and it subtracts 2 from all dimensions.
then it prints the current stats.
i can write &quot;enacc pushup 10&quot; and it logs that i gained 10 pushup points.
i can just write &quot;enacc&quot; and it displays usage and the comments from ~/.enacc.
i keep my current dimensions and costs in the comments in that file,
so this way i can easily remind myself of my commitments.
here&apos;s an example run:
</p>

<pre>
  $ enacc
  enacc - energy accounter.
  usage 1: enacc [dim val]...
  usage 2: enacc [val]
  dim is either &apos;sub&apos; or one of the energy dimensions.
  dim &apos;sub&apos; subtracts val from each energy dimension.
  otherwise val is added to the specific dimension.
  val on its own is the same as &apos;sub val&apos;.
  ~/.enacc file comments and energy levels:
  # dimensions:
  # - push: 1 ordinary pushup.
  # - pull: 1 inverted row with the help of a desk.
  # - jump: 2 jumping jumps for each energy point.
  # costs:
  # - checking email or running the todo script: 2
  # - for each minute of video entertainment: 1
  # - for each minute of gaming: 1
  # - checking on memes or aggregators: 10
  # - eating junk food: 10
  # - fapping: 20
  push:24 pull:14 jump:14
</pre>

<p>
that output was generated from this file:
</p>

<pre>
  $ cat ~/.enacc
  # dimensions:
  # - push: 1 ordinary pushup.
  # - pull: 1 inverted pushup with the help of a desk.
  # - jump: 2 jumping jumps for each energy point.
  # costs:
  # - checking email or running the todo script: 2
  # - for each minute of video entertainment: 1
  # - for each minute of gaming: 1
  # - checking on memes or aggregators: 10
  # - eating junk food: 10
  # - fapping: 20

<p>
i track a full timestamp here because for computers that&apos;s not a problem.
i keep this script in my utilities repo here:
https://github.com/ypsu/cfg/blob/master/utils/enacc.c
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s a linux commandline utility though.
there are probably gazillion more mature apps doing the same.
maybe they can make the tracking even simpler.
i don&apos;t know, i haven&apos;t researched this area online,
i might have missed some nice improvements.
i came up with this on my own
after being frustrated with watching too much anime recently.
maybe try the paper tracking first
before investing too much time in a complicated tool though.
</p>

<p>
i also don&apos;t track on what i wasted my energy points on.
it would just add more toil tracking this and i&apos;d be more likely to give up.
i want the process to be as easy as possible, so i only care about the numbers.
to be fair, i wouldn&apos;t even care about using a log format in my tool,
and just have like 3 numbers in a text file representing the actual levels.
the only reason i use the log format because then i can easily append to it.
i don&apos;t like rewriting files because it&apos;s brittle from coding perspective.
but appending to files is usually a very safe and easy operation to implement.
just think about tracking this on paper:
appending is the only sensible way to do it.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t actually know if i&apos;ll be able to commit myself to this system long term.
but uncertainty should stop me from trying random stuff.
it&apos;s definitely worth a try and see how it goes.

<h2 id="kbd">kbd</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>my experience with the ergodox keyboard with the norman layout.</p>
<p>
for a very long time i was using a very standard us keyboard with a us layout.
it was a das keyboard with the cherry mx brown switches.
i bought it about 10 years ago and it still works perfectly.
i average about 80 wpm on it.
i got the blank keycap version so that i forced myself to not look at the keys.
i never learned proper typewriting,
so my typing style was whatever that evolved from only using hunt and peck.
</p>

<p>
but one thing was bugging me:
the qwerty layout wasn&apos;t designed with efficiency or ergonomics in mind.
the staggered rows was annoying me most --
i was really inaccurate for the non-main row keys.
so about 8 years ago i learned about ergodox
and thought maybe i should try switching to that.
the design of that had at least some thought in it.
and if i switch i might as well ditch the qwerty layout
for something that also had some effort in it.
but i never made the switch.
i think one of the big reasons was price.
it&apos;s quite expensive and i would need two: one for work, one for home.
but now that most of the tech world switched to wfh,
my excuse sort of evaporated, and i could no longer resist the temptation.
i got one from ergodox-ez since i didn&apos;t want to build my own.
</p>

<p>
then i had to pick a new keyboard layout too.
there were many to choose from: dvorak, colemak, workman, norman, etc.
i went with the norman one since that seemed the newest one.
and has incorporated the lessons of the previous ones and improved on them.
</p>

<p>
so i got my ergodox and i installed norman on it.
the first few days were miserable.
i had less than 10 wpm with it.
every keypress needed several seconds of deliberation
since i didn&apos;t know where the keys were by instinct.
i didn&apos;t have any muscle memory.
it was frustrating to have my thoughts buffered up in my mind,
yet i couldn&apos;t express them, just very slowly.
that actually changed my thinking a little bit temporarily:
i thought and coded in a way that required less typing from me.
i don&apos;t remember how it was different though,
i didn&apos;t make notes about this.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about ergodox is that is super configurable.
it has an online configurator
where you can set up the keys to do whatever you want.
if that&apos;s not enough, then technically you could build your own firmware,
but i never reached that point.
i played a lot with the settings and the key placements.
first, i put space on those big thumb keys,
but then later i realized it&apos;s better if it&apos;s on a closer key.
i also moved the ; key away from it&apos;s default position in norman.
i use that key surprisingly often in the vim and tmux context,
often with a modifier (in tmux) so i thought it&apos;s better on a big fat key.
</p>

<p>
i also experimented with its autoshift feature.
the idea is that if you hold down a key long enough (175 ms by default)
then you get the shifted version.
the downside is that you can&apos;t keep a key held down for an autorepeat.
though this can be worked around by disabling autoshift in other layers.
i tried using this for a while.
i only enabled it for the number row and the symbols.
i liked the idea i could type anything without the shift.
but i never managed to get the timing right so i made a lot of typos
and later i felt it was slowing me down, so i eventually disabled this feature.
</p>

<p>
but the idea of the autoshift still intrigues me somewhat.
i wish there were tactile switches with two levels.
if you pressed down harder, then the other switch would activate.
so a light press would trigger &apos;4&apos;, a hard press would trigger &apos;$&apos;.
it&apos;s a bit tricky but i think it&apos;s not impossible to implement this.
on the other hand it might be a be bad idea.
one would need to watch their pressure this way too
and thus it might end up just a net drag over the long term.
but still, it&apos;s an interesting idea.
</p>

<p>
anyways, for reference, here&apos;s my current layout:
https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/QXjem.
i&apos;ll keep this up do date as i further change my layout.
</p>

<p>
i started using a few online tools to track my wpm.
every morning i measured my speed and looked at the improvement rate.
i even used sites like keybr.com to improve my improvement rate.
my improvement rate was about 10 wpm per week for the first 4 weeks.
so i could reach about 50 wpm on a good day after a month.
the progress since then is much slower.
i&apos;m still at around 60 wpm currently.
</p>

<p>
huge gains in wpm wasn&apos;t even my primary goal.
i think at the 70-80 range, the typing speed stops mattering,
since i can&apos;t think fast enough to go at it other than for short bursts.
however my goal was to improve my accuracy.
i had a feeling that i&apos;m a bit inaccurate on qwerty,
and i suspected it was because the illogical staggered layout.
but i&apos;m quite inaccurate on my ergodox too.
well, it&apos;s partly because of the new layout,
but even as i got familiar with it, i still make a lot of mistakes,
and then i have to retype a lot.
this is actually what currently tanks my wpm.
</p>

<p>
i was hoping the online tools could improve this.
but all of them are super forgiving when it comes to typos.
they let you go back and fix your mistakes.
what i really wanted is something that really drills correct writing.
i haven&apos;t found one so i started thinking of making my own tool.
i wanted an interface that shows me one specific text,
and keeps me practicing on that singular text until i master it.
this reminded me of the trackmania game from nadeo.
it&apos;s a car racing game where you get an elaborate track,
and you have race through it in as little time as possible.
you then get a bronze/silver/gold medal based on your performance.
it can even show you your replay in the form of a ghost car.
i wanted to have something like this just for typing.
i tried searching for &quot;typemania&quot;.
it had a lot of results but nothing useful.
so i decided to make my own html5 game and called it peckmania
in order to bypass all the bad results
in case someone else is looking for this too.
</p>

<p>
the resulting game is at /peckmania.
</p>

<p>
although trackmania lets you make mistakes and has checkpoints
i didn&apos;t add support for backspacing to delete the last character/word.
i guess i could make something like that, but i didn&apos;t bother.
i want to be able to learn to type long sentences without mistakes,
so i want to make the game as punishing as possible.
otherwise i won&apos;t learn to slow down to my still accurate writing speed.
if i can master this, i could then write even with closed eyes!
</p>

<p>
i also liked the medal and the ghostcar features in trackmania,
so i implemented ranking and typeline.
the biggest rank is for 100 wpm.
nobody needs to be faster than that anyways.
for reference 100 wpm is about 8.3 characters per second.
it&apos;s quite insane and some people can do even 150 wpm with ease.
the typeline is a visualization of a typing run:
it displays which key was pressed at which time on a horizontal timeline.
you could technically see which sections or combinations were fast or slow.
</p>

<p>
initially i wasn&apos;t sure how will i implement the typeline.
i was thinking of a fancy graphical rendering logic using the html5 canvas.
but one needs to be very careful to make that look good on all resolutions.
after a lot of thinking on how to make it all look nice,
i decided i should just stick to black and white text.
that&apos;s super simple to deal with.
implementing fancy graphics can take ages and i&apos;d never finish then.
but sticking to a barebones ui allowed me
to actually finish all the important features,
even if they are all presented in a somewhat non-traditional interface.
but at least i completed something.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m glad i stuck to black and white text
because i can now easily use the whole thing on a monochrome monitor.
yes, i&apos;m using a special monochrome eink monitor right now
and i have lot of pent up sadness about the state of accessibility on the web,
but let me save those for a later post.
</p>

<p>
when i started on peckmania,
i still had two keyboards connected to my primary machine,
hence i added support for &quot;save slots&quot;.
so if anybody else is in a similar situation, they can switch between the slots
to track their progress on the different keyboards or layouts separately.
</p>

<p>
i also wanted to make it easy to experiment with different texts,
so i made it easy to import a completely custom level set.
i even included a few default ones like german, hungarian, programming.
but one can just simply change the text after the hash in the url bar
and can train on any text they can enter there.
</p>

<p>
peckmania saves all the results locally.
just like how in old games it was easy to move savedata around,
i wanted to have a similar usability feature here too.
in the old days the games put things into files
but that is a bit hard in the age of the browsers.
i realized that one could just simply use the clipboard for this.
so i just added event listeners for the clipboard events
and manipulated those for the export/import features.
i think it&apos;s quite neat,
maybe this sort of pattern should be more common in the world.
i ensured that all the data is simple text,
so it&apos;s very easy for the users to move it around,
or even track it in a version control system if they wished so.
if they do that they could even build some custom stats over time.
</p>

<p>
anyways, my point is that i think i added all the important features i wished
and now i can pretty much consider this little game as done.
all i need to do now is to practice with it
and see if my accuracy improves over time or now.
we&apos;ll see.
</p>

<p>
anyways, back to ergodox.
initially i experienced some slight discomfort in my thumbs.
that lasted quite a few weeks as i was using it.
but now that i got used to the keyboard, it&apos;s not really there anymore.
i think moving the spaces to closer keys helped.
that thumb block is really not for such a common key like space.
i also feel that on a standard keyboard some keys are easier to reach.
the middle fat keys still feel a bit unnatural to press.
but maybe with time this will also improve.
otherwise, now that i&apos;m getting used to it, i start liking my ergodox.
i wouldn&apos;t really recommend it for average users,
but if you spend all your day in front of a computer in a static corner,
i think it might worth a try.
but don&apos;t be discouraged with the few weeks of reduced productivity
until you reach back the same throughput as with an ordinary keyboard.
just keep practicing with it.
</p>

<p>
as for the norman layout:
i think it&apos;s a good layout once i got the hang of it.
more stuff on the main row makes it easier to type english text for me.
and i didn&apos;t lose all my qwerty skills either.
after a few minutes of qwerty typing my brain switches back into qwerty mode
and i can type the same as before, maybe with a bit higher typo rate.
i don&apos;t do qwerty on the ergodox though.
i think having two completely different keyboard helps with this switching.
but one needs to regularly practice the switching
otherwise one is likely to forget about the other layout.
</p>

<p>
however i still have a lot of trouble when it comes to writing symbols.
i guess that&apos;s partly because i didn&apos;t practice those as much as english.
but hopefully with time i&apos;ll catch up on those too.
</p>

<p>
i also didn&apos;t remap any vim, tmux or i3 keys.
navigating in those became a bit painful
but i sort of got the hang of it eventually.
</p>

<p>
in summary: currently i&apos;m experiencing lower speed and higher typo rate,
but at least my curiosity is sated, doesn&apos;t bug me anymore.
so overall i&apos;m glad i tried the switch
and looks like i&apos;ll be using my norman ergodox for a while
to see if i can get back to a similar performance long term.
but this is just my stockholm syndrome speaking so take it with a grain of salt.
</p>

<p>
and remember, if peckmania is something that you&apos;d like to try,
it&apos;s at /peckmania.
</p>

<p>
edit: i keep some progress data at /kbdlog.
</p>

<p>
update after 8 months:
</p>

<p>
after 1 month i&apos;ve reached 50 wpm.
after 3 months i&apos;ve reached 60 wpm.
the progress is very slow after that.
after 10 months i&apos;m still around 70 wpm with an accuracy about 98%.
</p>

<p>
what i did is that every morning i measured my speed on these two sites:
</p>

<ul><li>
  https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/
</li><li>
  https://thepracticetest.com/typing/practice/programming-symbols/
</li>
</ul>

<p>
but the text was quite random
and they were very forgiving when it came to typos.
i decided to ditch them and focus solely on peckmania.
now i even uploaded a full short story into it, press d1 to switch to it.
i&apos;ll be typing one line a day and see how that goes.
i think that will give me more value over time
because i can practice on the same text over and over again
even over multiple days if deem that i type a line too slow.
i almost managed to finish all the main english lines at 80 wpm with perfect accuracy,
some taking multiple attempts over multiple days.
there&apos;s no point rushing this:
i did notice that i can type the same text much faster the next day.
i just need to give each line one or two decent attempts each day.
i think the text randomness was slowing my progress down.
we&apos;ll see.
in any case i&apos;ll no longer track my speed so my morning ritual becomes simpler.
the tracking overhead was annoying me anyways.
</p>

<h2 id="tscriting">tscriting</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>the backstory of the /tscriter tool.</p>
<p>
earlier this year i had this crazy idea that i wanted to learn german.
i looked around and found smartergerman.com
which would allow you to learn german online alone.
it was quite fine for a while
but i think having access to a private teacher is much better.
so i eventually stopped using the site in favor of the teacher,
well, at least as long as my job was reimbursing the lessons.
</p>

<p>
anyways, as i was lurking on a site I&apos;ve seen
that its owner was looking for someone to replicate a tool he has seen online.
this tool basically plays you a video,
and then you have to enter what you heard.
you can keep replaying the audio/video until you got your sentence right.
you can also ask for some hints too.
the guy tried to contact the owners of the tool he found,
but they weren&apos;t responsive at all, hence he looked someone to replicate it.
he wanted to play around with such a tool
and if people like it, he might even add it to his site.
i thought that would be a fun tool to work on.
</p>

<p>
so i volunteered that i can give a stab at it.
he even wanted to pay but i refused since i didn&apos;t want to deal with the taxes.
besides, what i had in mind was quite trivial,
i wouldn&apos;t really ask money for this.
</p>

<p>
for this project i came up with the name &quot;tscriter&quot;.
i meant it as a play on the phrase &quot;transcription tester&quot;.
i created a github project for it and started implementing it.
then we iterated for a while.
i implemented some features, and then he gave me feedback.
working like this was quite nice.
i even added some css after all the prompting.
i think it&apos;s more motivating if you are creating something for someone
rather than when you are creating something for yourself.
</p>

<p>
however as time went on and he played with my tool,
he realized that he wanted to have something different.
he wanted the tool to allow entering the full text,
and then count the mistakes like in a real dictation.
i thought this is also interesting but it should be a separate tool
rather than changing what i was working on at the moment.
i think someone else also volunteered to him
and that someone else did the dictation tool for him
so we sort of lost touch after this.
but he did upload my tool and asked their users to test it.
the results were mixed: some people liked it, some people not.
after seeing that, i guess he didn&apos;t go forward with adding my tool to his site.
</p>

<p>
you can check out the tool at /tscriter.
we were testing it with this smartergerman text: /tscriter#smartergerman.txt
</p>

<p>
i can no longer see any reference to this tool on his site
so i thought i&apos;ll delete the project from github
and put it on my blog to let it rest in peace.
</p>

<p>
before i stopped working on the project, i&apos;ve added a few more features.
all he wanted is just audio playback + a text entry box.
but eventually i figured out i can easily play back youtube videos,
and i can easily fetch the youtube subtitles too.
so i added a feature where you point the tool at a youtube video,
it extracts the subtitles and let&apos;s you type that.
</p>

<p>
however the problem is that there are very few videos
with good quality subtitles.
and with google deprecating apis all the time,
i&apos;d expect it won&apos;t work for long anyways.
so i still retain the capability to define custom text.
one can either host the texts or just paste them directly into the tool.
</p>

<p>
overall, it think it was a nice little project, i learned a lot.
totally would do it again!
try it out and let me know what you think about it!
</p>

<h2 id="mornings">mornings</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>mornings are my productive time.</p>
<p>
i had a terrible track record of finishing anything i&apos;ve set out to do.
however i changed four things recently
and now i feel quite good about the progress on my little goals.
</p>

<p>
i often have an idea of a game or a tool that i&apos;d like to see.
sometimes i even start working on a demo for it.
but once the initial motivation is gone, i just pretty much abandon the project.
and then i feel bad about myself, and i wonder what&apos;s wrong with me.
i usually explain it &quot;ah surely work is draining my energy&quot;
and that &quot;all i need to do is retire and then i&apos;ll have energy for all this&quot;.
but then over time i started tweaking things and i&apos;ve noticed some nice changes.
in my case there are four components at play here:
</p>

<ul><li>
  scope of my goals or projects.
</li><li>
  maintaining the motivation.
</li><li>
  finding the time for the project.
</li><li>
  make project work a routine.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
scope
</p>

<p>
i had a very simple solution to the scope problem.
unless something is clearly trivial and finishable in very little time,
i changed all the goals from &quot;implement this&quot; to &quot;write a blog post about this&quot;.
now all my plans are suddenly feasible without retirement.
from past experience, writing down those ideas already give me the satisfaction
that i&apos;d get from implementing the stuff.
this is also a parenting 101 trick:
when the kid wants something that you don&apos;t want to give them,
often giving them in fantasy calms them down more than enough.
sometimes the fantasy satisfies even more than the actual reality
since everything looks and feels better in imagination.
</p>

<p>
i know some people are afraid of writing down their ideas
because they &quot;fear&quot; that other people steal them
and then make all the money that would be &quot;rightfully&quot; theirs.
for me there&apos;s nothing wrong with this.
that&apos;s actually the best outcome!
it means that the idea resonates with people
and when some other person implements it all
then it&apos;s like improving the world from an armchair without lifting a finger.
as for the money making bit:
i have a stable, good job, i don&apos;t care about the money bit.
actually, i don&apos;t even want to care about the money bit.
tbf, none of my queued up ideas are something that one could make money with.
i just wanted to mention that i wouldn&apos;t mind sharing business ideas either.
i wish other people would also be less secretive about their ideas.
sometimes it&apos;s quite hard to talk with such secretive people.
</p>

<p>
anyways, the point is that my plan is now just to write down more ideas
rather than actually try to implement them.
i have this single &quot;ideas&quot; plain text file with lots of junk in it.
with this approach i think it would be feasible for me to drain it.
it always bothered me that this file just keeps growing
and i never do anything about it.
i&apos;d totally want it to become an empty file.
if i can do that, i&apos;d feel like i reached the nirvana.
and maybe when i&apos;m old, retired and time millionaire,
i can just look at my blog posts and select some idea from there
so it&apos;s not like that the idea is lost after i got it out of my system.
</p>

<p>
however i still implement some ideas.
but only if i know it won&apos;t take ages.
ideally something that would only need a few hours, tops few days.
i tried implementing fps games in the past but then i abandoned them.
nowadays i&apos;d try to implement a single gun, and just reuse the doom maps.
so then i don&apos;t need to think about content at all,
i just need to make the existing content work with my engine,
which makes the project much smaller in scope.
makes it more achievable if i ever decide to work on something like this.
i even wrote about this idea in /shooter.
</p>

<p>
motivation
</p>

<p>
a problem with some of the longer projects is
that i eventually run out of steam.
i stop caring about the idea.
for one, my little endeavours don&apos;t really have a target audience.
there&apos;s nobody to please, there&apos;s nobody that would nag me to finish my goals.
i&apos;m aware of the idea of accountability partners, but i never tried that
because i&apos;m way too asocial to ask people to care about my silly things.
</p>

<p>
and besides, with bigger projects is often unclear when is it &quot;done&quot;.
if you work on a game and you are making everything,
you could always add one more feature, weapon, map.
or i once worked on a silly programming language
but i gave up when i had to start working on its standard library.
it felt just much work that nobody would care about anyways.
</p>

<p>
reducing the scope just enough that i can complete it in a few days helps.
then i don&apos;t need to struggle with the motivation.
however even small projects are often hard to finish
especially if i take a longer break (e.g. a vacation) in the middle of it.
when i come back, i see all the pending tasks needing completion,
and i just can&apos;t decide where to start again anymore.
it might be analysis paralysis.
</p>

<p>
i realized i need a rather softer way to get back into a project
every time i sit down to work on it.
i noticed that breaking down the tasks into trivial steps
and writing those steps down really helps.
i don&apos;t mean breaking down all the steps but just the immediate ones.
</p>

<p>
i started having a plain text file called &quot;tasks&quot; for my projects.
each line in it is a &quot;task&quot;.
there are two types of tasks:
</p>

<ul><li>
  relatively straightforward tasks that i can finish in about 10 minutes,
</li><li>
  large tasks, that need further breakdown.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
to keep the format simple, i just simply prefix the latter tasks with &apos;!&apos;.
when i start out a project, i map out all the tasks i plan to do,
generally in the form of large tasks.
i then break the tasks down into smaller ones as i go.
e.g. for this blog post i could for instance have the following tasks:
</p>

<ul><li>
  mention analysis paralysis
</li><li>
  mention task types
</li><li>
  explain how i process the tasks
</li><li>
  ! explain the time component
</li><li>
  ! explain the routine component
</li>
</ul>

<p>
then i just go from top to the bottom and work on the tasks.
if the topmost task is a large (!) task,
then my task is to break it down and replace it with smaller tasks,
that i&apos;m actually capable of doing almost any time.
as you can see in the above example, the topmost tasks are simple ones.
</p>

<p>
in the old times i tried to juggle the breakdown in my head.
however being explicit about this really helps.
especially being methodical about going from top to bottom,
i no longer feel paralysed by the remaining work,
since i can see the end right in front of me.
and i don&apos;t really need to think hard about the next item
to tackle at any given moment since that&apos;s given too.
and it&apos;s quite satisfying to see the todo items disappearing
as i&apos;m committing my changes.
all i need now is to give the project some dedicated time.
if i do that, then i certainly make progress,
and making progress is often quite motivating on its own.
</p>

<p>
time
</p>

<p>
i believe that the time aspect was one of the most crucial aspects for me.
i tried to work on my hobby projects either on the weekends
or the evenings after work.
but the time available for me was very spotty.
the weekend usually didn&apos;t work out since i had to tend my family.
in fact tending my family even frustrated me a bit
since i couldn&apos;t use that time for my own stuff.
the evenings didn&apos;t really work out reliably either.
my kid goes to bed at somewhat random time
which means some days i have more time, some days i have less,
and that was frustrating.
especially if i have less time remaining, i don&apos;t feel like starting anything
since i feel that i won&apos;t be able to achieve anything.
and besides, by the end of the day i was tired,
i was at the lowest &quot;energy levels&quot;, least motivated.
</p>

<p>
when my motivation was very high,
i did manage to make some progress in the evenings and on some lucky weekends,
but i did not make steady progress, it was just sporadic progress.
i thought that my official work is my primary blocker here,
and that if i retired, i&apos;d be able to work on these things.
all i need is just struggle through my work years.
i was wrong.
</p>

<p>
earlier this year i decided to track my myopia progression.
this entails me regularly measuring my focus reach with a measuring tape.
later i&apos;ll write a post about this
but for now the point is that i had a developed a regular habit.
initially, while the motivation was high. i measured multiple times a day.
then once i got the technique and the logging mechanics down,
i wanted to minimize the time i spend on this,
so i decided that i&apos;d measure myself once daily.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve set up a little daily reminder for myself
(see the reminder file in my /task post for my reminder mechanics).
so basically this reminder was the first thing i&apos;ve seen each morning,
which meant it was the first thing i did
whenever i first sat down in front of my machine.
i&apos;ve noticed that doing this little thing each morning wasn&apos;t a big effort.
</p>

<p>
later this year i got a new keyboard with a new layout (see my /kbd post).
i decided to track my typing speed once a day in the morning too.
so each morning i measured my eyes and my typing speed.
those were my &quot;dailies&quot;.
i found it actually quite nice to have something &quot;done&quot; each day.
and i could do this even on the weekend mornings
if i decided to wake up before everyone else.
so i decided to wake up around 6am every day or a bit sooner if i could manage.
in the summer times it&apos;s easier for me to wake up earlier thanks to the sun.
but this meant i couldn&apos;t stay up too late,
so i started having a &quot;go to bed alarm&quot; too and i went to bed at 10pm every day.
</p>

<p>
so there i was, up early in the morning and i could see from my apartment window
that all the other people were still sleeping.
it was quite a nice feeling being awake alone in the world.
it felt like the right &quot;me time&quot;.
it felt like this is the time i should be doing something productive.
so i decided to use these mornings to make progress on my personal projects.
</p>

<p>
it worked out great.
it turns out i&apos;m a morning person, mornings is when i have to most energy,
morning is when my motivation is at the highest levels.
and in the mornings i have more time flexibility too.
if i need a few more minutes to finish something,
i just start my work a bit later.
in the time of the work from home this is quite easy to achieve.
</p>

<p>
routine
</p>

<p>
i started doing this morning ritual for my todo items
when i was setting up a new raspberry pi for my new eink screen.
this contained lot of tasks, including tweaking xterm source
so that it completely ignores colors on this machine.
delving into a foreign codebase is a bit scary for me,
but breaking down the tasks into very manageable pieces like
&quot;download the source&quot;, &quot;build it&quot;, &quot;make it work&quot;, &quot;grep for color&quot;, etc
really helped to maintain momentum.
and i did all this before checking my emails or todo items for the day.
avoiding the reality in the morning helped me to focus on my tasks,
i wouldn&apos;t start obsessing about the daily churn that i have in front of me.
</p>

<p>
once i was done with the setup,
i decided to use my mornings to finish /peckmania.
that worked out great too.
then i decided to make a tool for myself to better manage my issues at work.
it worked greatly, i managed to finish what i&apos;ve set to.
working on small little projects in the mornings became a routine.
i&apos;m writing this post in the mornings too.
</p>

<p>
and it was a good routine:
it meant that every morning i achieved something, even if a little thing.
it also lightened my mood, i felt a bit more productive at work too.
i no longer had &quot;zero days&quot; where i achieved absolutely nothing
which usually led to feeling a bit sad afterwards.
if i missed a morning, i felt an uneasiness until i did my dailies.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s another thing that really helped to not break the routine so far:
not trying to do large things in parallel.
if i want to read a book, watch through a tv show, play a video game,
now i queue it up as &quot;project&quot;.
i just consume such things after i finished my current project.
and i do them primarily in the morning.
this way i have much fewer regretful thoughts about
what i should be doing instead while binge watching a new anime.
i know that i can enjoy that show or game without regret,
since i&apos;m between little projects,
so it&apos;s like a mini holiday that i earned for myself.
</p>

<p>
eventually i picked up a few more routine habits over time.
since i&apos;m in switzerland, i feel like i should have some german comprehension.
therefore i&apos;m reading a page or two of german text every morning
and then look up and write down all the unknown words i encounter in it.
i use the online linguee site for this and with my eink screen it&apos;s quite nice
that i still don&apos;t actually have to look at some bright screen in the morning.
my computer time in the morning is almost like reading a book.
hopefully over time this will improve my german vocabulary
and i&apos;ll be able to navigate this german world a little bit better.
actually this became the first routine i do in the morning,
since some slow reading and writing is a very nice way to wake up.
</p>

<p>
in the old times, while i lived in dublin, i used to walk a lot every day.
that&apos;s no longer true in zürich, especially now with all the work from home.
so i decided to reinstate some morning walks in the nearby small forest.
the fresh morning air is very nice.
i just wish the forest was bigger so that i could walk more.
</p>

<p>
i also changed my evening structure.
in the old days i just used to watch youtube or read the internet
until i got bored and went to bed.
for one, i now go to bed at 22:00 quite punctually.
but before that i try to avoid the computer from 20:00 or so.
i just take my notebook and freeform write into it
about anything that comes to my mind, basically reflecting.
i just really like the feeling of freewriting.
this usually involves thinking about future plans and what i should be doing.
a lot of good things have come out of this.
i decided to do that german reading practice
after hours of thinking what easy and fun thing i could do to learn some german.
even deciding to start walking again was thanks to a lot of reflecting.
without all this reflecting i feel like i&apos;m on autopilot
and never really consider trying new things, so i really need it.
another benefit of just simply writing rather than consuming something is
that it helps me start feeling tired sooner which in turn helps fall asleep.
</p>

<p>
though i&apos;d add that this doesn&apos;t mean that i never procrastinate.
sure, i do that when at work and i&apos;m unsure what to do.
however i don&apos;t procrastinate in the mornings,
and that&apos;s the important point here.
</p>

<p>
effect
</p>

<p>
when i add together all the things i mentioned above, they do magic for me.
i think if i were to take to away any component, my system would fall apart.
but thanks to them, i feel quite good about my days,
i no longer feel that &quot;only if i&apos;d retire, could i really achieve my goals&quot;.
progress towards one&apos;s goals can be made anytime with the right habits.
one just need to find them with lots of reflection.
</p>

<h2 id="slowpals">slowpals</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>a penpals site idea.</p>
<p>
i really like discussing various ideas.
i especially like when people challenge my views
since that means i can sharpen my arguments or perhaps change my views.
</p>

<p>
however doing this in an online discussion forum is quite exhausting.
if you post something dumb in a public space,
then you get lot of responses, some of them mean even.
it&apos;s infeasible and pointless to respond to everyone.
even if you do,
you might still get another barrage of responses to any of your replies.
</p>

<p>
one solution to this is to avoid public discussions.
private discussions are often more fruitful
because you have more time and energy to focus
on really understanding that single person&apos;s perspective.
you&apos;ll be more likely be able to stand in their shoes
if this other person is open to invest the energy to make this happen.
</p>

<p>
for online discussions i believe plain text emails is a good way to discuss.
this means what you need is a good penpal finding site rather than a forum.
since one doesn&apos;t really want to reveal their email address nilly-willy,
ideally the platform would allow exchanging messages through itself.
however even with penpal sites,
it&apos;s very likely that you send a letter to someone,
and then you don&apos;t get any feedback or response to your letter,
and then you don&apos;t know if you were rude,
or if your partner just lacks the energy to respond.
ideally there would be something that incentivizes users to respond.
</p>

<p>
so here&apos;s an idea for a penpal site
that i think could be quite trivial to implement,
and requires almost no resources even.
this would an online platform that could easily scale up to millions of users
and still be operated from a small raspberry pi
because you could outsource many of its operations to free online services.
i&apos;d totally implement it myself if i knew of a couple folks that would sign up.
</p>

<p>
it would consist of two parts:
a static online site that lists all the profiles along with the profile data;
and an email address through which one can interact with the platform.
</p>

<p>
the static online site would be a plaintext document (hosted on e.g. github)
that just lists the usernames and their profile text.
i wouldn&apos;t bother with profile pics and whatnot, plaintext should be enough.
</p>

<p>
then i&apos;d have an email address, e.g. slowpals at gmail,
and the users have to register and talk to others through that address.
e.g. an user wishing to register could send an email to slowpals+admin at gmail
with a title &quot;register &lt;usename&gt;&quot; and with their profile text as the body.
then a script would process this email
and upload their profile to that online site above.
(in emails everything after + is ignored, so you can use that for such tricks.)
</p>

<p>
now comes the interesting part: exchanging messages.
suppose alice notices and likes bob&apos;s profile.
she can start a conversation by sending an email to slowpals+bob at gmail.
slowpals will then forward the email to bob&apos;s private address.
however there are three important rules that would make this interesting.
</p>

<ul><li>
  oneaday rule: you can send and receive a single message per day.
</li><li>
  replyfirst rule: you can&apos;t send or receive another message
  until you responded to your most recently received message.
</li><li>
  onethread rule: you can only have one active thread by person.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
my goal here is to artificially &quot;slow down&quot; conversations
in the hopes that they remain more civilized this way.
rather than delivering all the messages at send time,
slowpals would queue them up, and deliver them one at a time.
each user would have a first in first out queue.
so if charlie also sends a message to bob,
bob will receive the message from charlie only the next day
after he responded to alice.
and bob can expect a response from alice:
the only way to not receive one is
if alice decides to not use the site anymore.
alice will not have access to the rest of the members
until she responded to bob&apos;s email.
this also ensures that one doesn&apos;t get a barrage of emails.
one can expect that on this site one only receives a few messages,
and that one will never be overwhelmed by them.
in fact, this platform degrades gracefully:
if you stop responding, slowpals will stop nagging you,
it&apos;s as if you simply deactivated your account
and i&apos;d even delete your profile from the public listing
if you didn&apos;t respond to an email for a month.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s one point to note:
there should be a way to end conversations
so that they don&apos;t go forever for no good reason.
it should be possible to annotate messages for which you don&apos;t expect a reply.
the same way it should be possible to report spam messages.
i&apos;m thinking of using the first line of message for optional directives.
e.g. for a message like this (involving slowpals+alice and slowpals+bob):
</p>

<pre>
  !noreply
</pre>

<pre>
  hi alice! it was nice chatting with you! cheers!
</pre>

<p>
alice wouldn&apos;t be expected to respond.
she would get this email and the next day she would get another one
regardless if she responded or not.
that day she can start a new conversation with another member instead.
</p>

<p>
note that the oneaday rule makes it hard to start new conversations
when your queue is not empty.
i think this can be considered a feature rather than a bug.
you should make the most of your existing conversations
and you should respond promptly.
most people are quite lazy when it comes to emails,
so eventually your queue would drop to zero,
which would also allow you to start new threads.
</p>

<p>
the slowness might be annoying when you start to like the other person.
however in that situation you can exchange your real email address
and you can have your discussions in real time.
</p>

<p>
and it would be quite easy to implement this site
since the email queues would be stored in gmail.
all i need is a daily cronjob that processes these emails
and forwards the messages according to the above rules.
and after i forwarded a message, i can simply delete it from gmail.
it&apos;s quite nice from the user data perspective,
since i only need to store queued emails.
the only sensitive data that needs to be carefully maintained
is the password to this gmail address and the username to email address mapping.
</p>

<p>
to keep this simple, i&apos;d probably also enforce a plaintext rule:
if you send an email with html or with attachments,
i&apos;d just simply reject your email.
i&apos;d limit the message size to 100k too.
and i&apos;d highly encourage people to strip the previous message from the body
since i really don&apos;t see the value of that in this context.
</p>

<p>
with such rules i&apos;d totally try participating in such a community.
i don&apos;t think anybody reads this blog but if you do
and you like the idea of such a penpal site then let me know.
then i might be motivated enough to build it.
or if you know that such a site already exists,
then also let me know, i might sign up.
</p>

<h2 id="postmore">postmore</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>blog more and link posts to keep discussions shorter.</p>
<p>
when i partake in some philosophical email discussions,
i tend to write overly long emails.
and usually such emails contain thoughts about multiple topics.
this can be quite exhausting for the recipient to read and respond.
</p>

<p>
often those subtopics could be a blog post on their own.
while i appreciate the nuance and understanding that comes from 1:1 discussions,
there&apos;s no reason to limit ideas to two people.
ideas are meant to be exchanged!
maybe twitter was right: one should keep the direct messages short.
instead we should write more on our public spaces
and simply link them in discussions.
when a reader wants to respond, they can just write their own public post.
not responding to a public post feels less rude
than not responding to a direct message.
it feels much easier to ignore a link than a long passage of text in an email.
</p>

<p>
this is not the same as a forum discussion.
first, forum posts are in a context of a thread,
while a blog post ideally stands on its own.
you can&apos;t just write &quot;this is dumb&quot; as a post on its own.
second, you can disable comments on your own blog,
and then you&apos;ll get less responses so you&apos;ll have to worry less about them.
besides, more often than not,
comments bikeshed about the small points, or the specific metaphores you used,
rather than talking about the overall message of the post.
this then makes the comments section not a very informative place.
if one has an insightful addendum or rebuttal,
they should write a post on their own, notify the original author,
and that author should link to that post in their original post.
this is a lot more effort than comments,
but i think the resulting quality is worth the effort over the long term.
it also limits the amount of the content associated with each post
which is rather quite an underappreciated quality these days.
</p>

<p>
in other words i&apos;m suggesting that people should blog more.
sure, more posts mean less quality and more half digested ideas.
but i think that&apos;s fine, the posts don&apos;t have to be perfect.
maybe over time you learn more and completely disagree with your old posts,
or maybe even regret or are ashamed of your old posts.
i think it&apos;s still worth to keep the old posts,
so that people can see how you changed over time.
you can simply edit that old post to include links to your updated views.
eventually we&apos;ll all die and everything will be in vain,
so in the end there&apos;s nothing to lose by opening up a little bit
and writing about the thoughts swirling in one&apos;s head.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m actually trying to convince myself to write more with this post.
i have a lot of small things
that i just want to see written down somewhere publicly.
most of them are possibly dumb things that i&apos;m somewhat reluctant to share.
but maybe i shouldn&apos;t be and i should still make a post about them
even if it&apos;s like a one sentence&apos;s worth of content.
even this post fits that criteria:
i don&apos;t really have anything interesting to say here,
and yet i&apos;m already in the 5th paragraph.
actually, this post is very similar to the freewriting i often do in notebooks.
just jotting down thoughts one after the other as they come.
now that i&apos;m doing it for a long time, i see the psychological benefits
of having a much calmer, less stressed mind in general.
so i might as well do it in the form of posts more often.
and others should write more too!
</p>

<h2 id="goldentesting">goldentesting</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>an alternative to unittesting.</p>
<p>
ugh, i really hate unittests.
they might look nice for some trivial cases
but for modules requiring more complicated setups and dependencies
they just feel like boring busywork.
and every time i want to make a change,
i&apos;m now required to maintain the unittests too.
sure, they catch an error sometimes,
but more often i&apos;m making an intentional change,
and now i have to implement that change at multiple places.
i often dread making changes
because i don&apos;t want to deal with the weird unittests some projects have.
</p>

<p>
but here&apos;s the good news:
i firmly believe all this unittesting madness will go away
when people learn that there is a much better alternative: goldentesting.
i think that&apos;s the most common term for this.
but i heard the terms of output testing or gold master testing too.
the primary reason it&apos;s not super common yet is
that there&apos;s no good generic tooling for it.
but i&apos;m pretty sure tools will slowly get there.
though it&apos;s used in some niche areas for a very long time already.
</p>

<p>
the unittest idea is this: you write code and litter it with assertions.
the goldentest idea is this: you write code and emit text to stdout.
during code review you just need to review the diffs,
you don&apos;t need to maintain the assertions manually.
</p>

<p>
suppose you write some c++ class like this:
</p>

<pre>
  class mystring { ... };
</pre>

<p>
unittests could look like this (oversimplified):
</p>

<pre>
  int main() {
    mystring s(&quot;helló&quot;);
    assert(s.length() == 6);
    assert(s.size() == 6);
    return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>
goldentests would look like this (oversimplified):
</p>

<pre>
  int main() {
    mystring s(&quot;helló&quot;);
    printf(&quot;%s length %d\n&quot;, s.c_str(), (int)s.length());
    printf(&quot;%s size %d\n&quot;, s.c_str(), (int)s.size());
    return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>
running this code would then output this:
</p>

<pre>
  helló length 6
  helló size 6
</pre>

<p>
you might be inclined to commit this output next to the code,
but that&apos;s a bit spammy.
however this is where better tooling could come handy:
that tool could run the test binary at both old and new versions,
and then just present you the diff
that you and the reviewer must explicitly acknowledge before merging.
</p>

<p>
for example let&apos;s assume that some user comes along
and wants that the length() function should be unicode aware.
if you simply make the change in your code
then both unit and goldentests will fail.
the unittest will fail with an assertion
that you then have to manually fix.
the goldentest will present you this diff:
</p>

<pre>
  -helló length 6
  +helló length 5
   helló size 6
</pre>

<p>
all you and the reviewer needs to do here is to acknowledge the diff.
the commit itself doesn&apos;t need to be littered with the test changes.
after the merge, you don&apos;t need to worry about this diff anymore.
</p>

<p>
you don&apos;t even need to hardcode that &quot;helló&quot; string.
it can come from from the stdin.
then you can easily create multiple testcases
simply by running this test binary on multiple inputs.
</p>

<p>
what is the function of the tests even?
i believe there are two main functions:
increase our confidence that the code is correct,
and to catch inadvertent regressions.
i claim that goldentests can do both with greater ease.
</p>

<p>
how do you get confident that your code is correct in general?
you usually write some code and then check that it is doing the expected things.
with goldentests you pretty much stop here and commit.
with unittests you go one step further:
you add assertions for those expectations.
basically you are setting up a trap for future maintainers
to painstakingly maintain your assertions.
in the goldentests those assertions are still there
but rather in an implicit manner so it still achieves the same goals.
</p>

<p>
and they are just as effective catching regressions as the unittests.
you just need the right tooling
to enforce the same standards for goldentests as for the unittests.
</p>

<p>
goldentests scale much better for larger codebases.
suppose you are maintaining some logging library.
and now you suddenly want to change its output format.
more likely than not, in the unittest world there are assertions
that are asserting your very specific line format for some reason.
if you want to change the format,
then you have to create a massive change that changes all such tests too.
with goldentests this will just create a massive diff.
however chances are that the diff will be very redundant
and with some additional tooling (again, more tooling)
you would be able to canonicalize all the diffs
and you would end up with a small diff that you can easily inspect
and determine that your change doesn&apos;t change the logic, just the output format.
</p>

<p>
goldentests are more generic too.
for instance you could use it for compiler or linter warnings.
one of the generated output files could be warnings.
the diff tool for this would be smart enough to remove preexisting ones.
so whenever you are working on some code,
you would only see the new warnings that you introduce.
sure, sometimes a warning is wrong (otherwise it would be an error),
this method lets you acknowledge the warning and still commit,
without adding silly &quot;nolint&quot; comments to silence the warning forever.
the warning will be silenced automatically from the point of the commit.
if the reviewer thinks this is undesired,
they can ask the change&apos;s author
to add a todo to address the warning in the future.
this shines the best when you want to enable a new warning for your codebase.
you can simply enable the warning and ignore the resulting diff.
nobody will see that new warning for existing code,
so you are not adding a large burden on others suddenly.
the warning will only appear for new code which people will then address.
and the warning is still in the full generated file,
so if you want to clean up the whole codebase yourself,
you can just simply fix the existing instances one by one
and see that the number of warnings go down over time.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s a practice of writing tests first, code later.
goldentests work for this too!
you can simply write down the expected output of your test app,
and then keep hacking at your library and test app code
until you get diff neutral.
you can write down the expected output without code or compiler.
maybe your teammate can just write down sample inputs and sample outputs,
and you can readily use that, no need to put it into assertions.
</p>

<p>
if you ever done coding competitions (acm icpc, topcoder, hackerrank)
then that environment is totally like this
and it&apos;s quite a satisfying environment,
especially when you see that your code passes all the tests.
when you solve a problem there,
you are usually pretty confident about your code.
and all they needed is some sample input and output text files.
furthermore all such testing is independent of the programming language.
with diff testing you can decide that you&apos;ll rewrite your slow python script
into some fast c++ code.
with unittesting it can be quite hard to see
that your rewrite had no effect on the logic.
with goldentesting all you need to verify is that the diffs are neutral
and then you&apos;ll be pretty much confident about your change.
</p>

<p>
at work i decided to write a little script
that parses a schedule file and outputs a nice text calendar
to visualise who is on duty and when.
actually, such calendar visualizations already existed,
what i really wanted is to visualize the diffs in a calendar
whenever someone is making a change to the schedule.
such a tool didn&apos;t exist before for these schedule files.
so i wrote a tool that parses and compares the old and new schedule files,
and then displays a calendar that has the differing days highlighted.
this is an example of one writing a special diffing tool:
most of the time the total state doesn&apos;t really matter,
all we care about is the diff.
but that&apos;s not even the point:
my point is that i didn&apos;t write any ordinary unittests for this tool.
all i did is that i hand written some sample inputs (old+new file pairs),
and just committed the generated output from them
since there&apos;s no good standard tooling for tracking golden diffs so far.
i kept adding inputs until i reached very high code coverage
as reported by the coverage tools.
when i reached that, i was confident that i handled most edge cases.
and obviously i carefully verified
that the output is what it should be for all the sample inputs.
</p>

<p>
it worked out great.
the most utility came after i released the tool
and people pointed out that i made a few wrong assumptions about the schedules.
so whenever i fixed a bug,
all i needed to do is to add a new sample input to cover that case.
or if it altered the output of an existing case,
it was very easy and obvious to see what was the effect of my change.
i usually don&apos;t get such a visceral feedback from unittests.
or sometimes people wanted me to alter the output a bit.
that was easy to do: i made formatting change
and in the diffs it was easy to see how the new format looked like.
i still love maintaining this piece of code
because it&apos;s super easy to make changes in it
while maintaining a high confidence in its correctness.
</p>

<p>
another example of such an environment would be
the deployment configs of the service of the team i worked at once.
this was a huge service consisting of many binaries running in many locations.
the system that runs these binaries needs the configuration
in a very denormalized manner.
so in the end we need to have (binaries * locations) number of configs.
to generate those configs we obviously use lot of templating.
there is a shared template
but then each binary must customize that (e.g. different cmdline arguments)
and then each location can have further customizations
(e.g. to test something in a single location only).
how would you test something like that?
you can&apos;t really.
e.g. you set a new cmdline flag for a binary to launch your new feature.
do you add a test into the configs that a flag is set?
that would be pretty dumb busywork.
what we had instead is that
for each change we just generated all the old+new denormalized configs
and then you inspected the diffs and verified
that your change does what you expected.
however on its own there would be massive diffs
just because of the sheer amount of binaries and locations we had.
e.g. you make a cmdline flag change in a binary&apos;s config
and now you have 30 files with a diff because we have 30 locations.
so we had a tool that canonicalized the diffs
(replaced references to location names with a placeholder string),
then it hashed the diffs
(just the lines with a diff, unchanged lines didn&apos;t matter),
and grouped the files into buckets based on their diff hash.
this worked out pretty nice since each cmdline flag was on their own line.
so what you actually need to do is to review a single diff
because then you can be sure that the rest of the diffs are the same.
if a single location has some special logic on the flag you are changing
and the diff looks different then that diff will go into a different bucket,
so you&apos;ll notice that too.
(sidenote: it&apos;s true that in this system weird overrides can silence some diffs,
but this could be combated with good discipline called &quot;weird needs to expire&quot;.
so all such weird overrides must have a clear deadline associated with them
at which point somebody will follow up and hopefully remove it.)
</p>

<p>
anyways, the point here is that i quite liked working in this system
simply because my confidence was very high in it.
the configuration pipeline was quite a mess
and sometimes very hard to understand,
but at least silly unittests weren&apos;t getting into my way
whenever i wanted to make a change.
i just made a change, looked at the diff,
and if it looked right, i knew it was fine.
this also made the review much much easier.
sometimes people implement quite complicated logic to achieve a thing.
but i don&apos;t really need to obsess too much about the logic itself.
all i need to look at the result and if it looks right,
i&apos;m not anxious about approving something that might be wrong.
even if it&apos;s wrong, i can see that it works for the cases we care about,
so it doesn&apos;t need to keep me up at night.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s one caveat to this.
if you generate such a golden output,
make sure the output is deterministic and easy to diff.
if you want to output a list then sort it and output the entries line by line.
randomly ordered output would give you lots of spurious diffs
that no human can easily understand.
with too much info on a single line it&apos;s hard to see
where the diff begins and where it ends.
often you want to make a change but then see that the diff is hard to review.
to alleviate this issue, if it appears, you can just prepare another change
that changes the output such that
it will make your subsequent change easy to review.
e.g. you make change that sorts a previously unsorted list.
two small focused diffs are often much easier to review
than one larger one that does too many things at once.
</p>

<p>
however there is one significant area
where golden diffs are really lacking in tooling: interaction tests.
maybe you have some client server architecture
and you want to verify that the interactions between them look good.
here&apos;s how i imagine testing such a thing.
let&apos;s assume we want to test a client&apos;s interaction with a server.
ideally there would be a tool that can record the request/reply interations.
so first i&apos;d run my client against the real server
and i&apos;d record the interactions.
then there would be a tool that could act as a fake server
with some preconfigured request/reply behavior.
then during the test i&apos;d just assert
that the interactions against the fake server
are exactly the same as in the golden recorded interactions.
these interactions would be committed along the code,
since during the test it would infeasible to bring up that server.
if the test interactions don&apos;t match,
i&apos;d rerun the recording tool
to rerecord the interactions against the real server and commit that.
so in the review one could see how the interactions changed too.
this is quite similar to what happens in interaction unittests already
but there people manually copy paste the interactions into assertions.
in this solution that would be replaced by running a single tool.
</p>

<p>
now as with all things in life
the question between explicit asserts and implicit diffs as tests
is a question of tradeoffs.
assertions have their place too in some cases.
e.g. when you know there is no point in continuing some logic
then sure, assert it away.
and then maybe you can enforce that all tests must run successfully to end.
so basically you have a bit of both.
but i really hope that over time the tooling will improve just enough
that this idea will catch on and then hopefully life will be much easier
for code maintainers in general.
</p>

<p>
now it&apos;s true that acknowledging a diff is much easier
than painstakingly update an assertion or expectation.
so chances are that this might lead to more mistakes.
however i&apos;m not convinced that we should avoid mistakes at all costs.
rather, we should strive for an environment where mistakes are cheap.
changes should be rolled out progressively,
changes should be able to easily rolled back, and so on.
then we can focus more on the useful, new developments,
rather than doing busywork with maintaining silly assertions.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve tried talking with a few folks about this.
so far i managed to convince nobody about this idea.
fortunately this theory of mine would be quite easy to &quot;test&quot;.
i mean a sociological experiment on developers.
you devise a project that a person has to finish.
you make a version with goldentests and a version with unittests.
then you divide people into two groups:
one gets the goldentest one and is instructed to continue with that,
the other one gets the unittest one and is instructed to continue with that.
after the experiment you run a survey
on how easy it was to work with the project
and how confident are their about their code&apos;s correctness.
you also review the time it took to finish the project,
and also review their code to see how many mistakes they missed.
i predict that the goldentest group will take less time,
will be more confident about their code,
and the correctness rate will be just about equal.
the only problem is i&apos;m too lazy and inexperienced to run such an experiment.
i hope one day someone runs it and then we&apos;ll see if i was right or not.

<p style=font-weight:bold>a fun, personalized challenge for some kids.</p>
<p>
in /challenge i mentioned an idea of a challenge event i could run.
but lately i was thinking a bit about it.
perhaps that idea is a bit too impersonal, too steep as a starting point.
i remembered how i all started developing my interest in computers
at about an age of 10.
there was actually a &quot;competition&quot; aimed at my level.
you could sign up for it
and then they would send you some questions via snail mail.
then you would anwser them and send the answers back via snail mail.
i started participating in this.
but when i was starting, i didn&apos;t really know the answers.
so one of the infotech teachers in the school started helping me.
we worked through the problems together.
</p>

<p>
two things happened here:
first, the letter format was a very good,
soft introduction to the world of computing.
second, i basically got a mentor out of this.
i spent a lot of time at that teacher.
i ran to him even between classes so that he explain some questions to me.
i&apos;m not sure why he invested so much time in me
(i took away his breaks after all),
but i&apos;m glad he did, since it helped me significantly.
</p>

<p>
so based on these observations and my previous ideas,
i think i&apos;d want to make a challenge site that consists of two parts.
there&apos;s a &quot;qualification&quot; phase that is done purely through email,
and there&apos;s a &quot;challenge&quot; phase
where the participants demonstrate their skills in person
a bit similarly to what i described in /challenge.
</p>

<p>
i think the qualification phase is important
to light the fire in the kids&apos; hearts.
i imagine it as follows:
a kid (or even adults if they wish) would sign up for my site.
then i&apos;d send the kid some easy questions.
e.g.:
</p>

<ul><li>
  what was the first computer?
</li><li>
  what are the computers good at doing?
</li><li>
  how do you look up information when you don&apos;t know something?
</li><li>
  how would you determine how many characters a piece of text has?
</li><li>
  you have a file with 1000 numbers.
  how would you create another file that has the each of those numbers doubled?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
then on later rounds the questions would become harder:
</p>

<ul><li>
  what is a programming language?
</li><li>
  what is a shell (e.g. bash)?
</li><li>
  what is a shell script?
</li><li>
  what is linux?
</li><li>
  where is javascript used?
</li><li>
  what is compilation?
</li><li>
  how would you compile and run some c code?
</li><li>
  write a hello world c program!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and stuff like that.
about 2-4 questions per round.
i&apos;d expect that the kids send the answer back in an email.
and i&apos;d limit the answer to 300 characters,
they would need to fit their answers into that limit.
</p>

<p>
the kids can use any help they need, i wouldn&apos;t really care.
and then i would answer each email individually.
depending on the letter i might even get a bit philosophical:
for example if for that information lookup question i get a googling answer,
i might respond that using teachers and mentors is also a good source,
and for some type of questions and problems, it&apos;s the only source.
if they didn&apos;t answer the questions correctly,
i might ask them why did that happen,
otherwise i&apos;d just send them the next set of questions.
</p>

<p>
if they persist through the qualification rounds (about 4-5 rounds)
i&apos;d introduce them to the &quot;challenges&quot; where you have actual coding tasks.
i&apos;d create 90 static &quot;challenges&quot;.
90 because i want to refer to the challenges as a number starting from 10.
keep in mind that these would be relatively easy challenges,
wouldn&apos;t go deep into the algorithms.
the idea is to keep them relatively easily achievable,
so that the kids can get a sense of achievement,
that would lead them to start studying these things deeper,
and maybe go on to the more mature national contests
to further hone their skills.
and the challenges have to remain relatively easy,
so that their cs teacher can easily work with the kids.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d make about 10 shell scripting tasks,
about 40 c tasks, and about 40 javascript tasks.
i think i can cover most important things with that.
the c and javascript challenges would be very similar
so basically i would be asking them to implement the same thing
in two entirely different languages.
the challenges themselves would be public,
anybody can read and prepare for them on their own.
think of relatively easy tasks,
like guess what number i&apos;m thinking or
draw a large ascii art christmas tree.
</p>

<p>
however the act of solving these tasks wouldn&apos;t be conducted online.
we&apos;d probably go to a computer lab after school together,
and i&apos;d expect that the kid demonstrates writing the solution without any help.
i wouldn&apos;t allow any references.
they shall memorize the syntax and the function parameters.
on the other hand they can try any time and retry any number of times.
so there&apos;s no pressure.
and to save time, they can do any number of challenges per session.
even one challenge per session is fine.
the challenges are intended to be easy enough
that one can solve multiple ones in a short amount of time,
depending on their experience.
if they manage to solve the problem without help,
i&apos;ll consider their challenge complete.
they can now either try another one,
or go home to prepare for the next one.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ll keep their solution for myself,
and after the session i&apos;d send them a review of their solution
or suggest improvements.
and if somebody manages to get through all the 90 challenges,
i&apos;ll add them to a &quot;hall of fame&quot; somewhere on the internet
or maybe even to a physical poster somewhere (e.g. on a school wall).
</p>

<p>
i also figured out how could i start the whole process:
when my kid becomes school age,
i&apos;m pretty sure there will be parent-teacher meetings.
i could ask the teachers on such occassions
if they were willing to advertise my challenges to the older kids.
starting with a single school is fine,
and from that on, i&apos;m hoping to rely on a word of mouth.
if that doesn&apos;t work out then i need to improve my product until it does.
i wouldn&apos;t want more few kids signing up for this though.
more than a dozen would be too much.
if i get more, i&apos;d just increase the difficulty of the qualification questions
to cull the less motivated ones.
</p>

<p>
or maybe rather than using emails,
i should stick to letters via snail mail
to cull out the less motivated ones (the ones lazy to go to the post office).
physical letter exchange might actually give it some extra excitement,
and it also allows me respond relatively slowly,
so that i can keep the pace of the whole thing is relatively slow.
this also requires some token amount of money to participate,
so i would be somewhat protected from spam
or from a suddenly very high subscription rate.
</p>

<p>
and i could run this here in switzerland even if i don&apos;t speak german well.
i can just keep everything in english
and let the kids deal with the english rather than me with the german.
at least they would have some extra motivation to learn english.
although i&apos;d probably accept german answers too but i wouldn&apos;t document this.
</p>

<p>
and i would only accept people from my local city.
i don&apos;t really want to deal with people that i can&apos;t meet personally.
i just want to give some interactive game for the local community.
</p>

<p>
more specifically i just want to give opportunity to kids
similar to what i received as a kid and more.
i very much wanted to get my schoolmates into coding too,
but nobody was that much interested.
even if i managed to get some people into this,
the competitions were way too fierce for them to keep along for long.
my hope with such a forgiving place would be to keep them interested.
the only way to lose is to give up
rather than being plain unlucky or not smart enough.
the kids can even prepare each other for my exams.
</p>

<p>
i know that there are nice online communities like khan academy.
but i can compare my experience with online and offline competitions:
offline competitions, one where i actually am next to the others
were usually a more exhilarating experience.
a person giving you some recognition in front of others feels more exciting
than watching a robot telling you that you did good
while you sit alone in a dark room, isolated from the world.
i just want to try giving such an experience for the next generation.
i think this idea could totally give that with a really little effort.
but it still requires effort from my part, so we&apos;ll see if i ever start this.
</p>

<h2 id="typer">typer</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>my wish for laptoplike device i'd like to exist.</p>
<p>
i don&apos;t usually use laptops, i much prefer the static desktop setups.
but i sometimes i do dream about what my ideal mobile computer would be.
my problem with most modern devices is
that they run these ultracomplicated operating systems
running all sorts of processes on it.
it bothers me because it uses up energy and battery unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
i wish for a machine that could last for weeks or months on a single charge.
ideally something that doesn&apos;t consume any energy if you don&apos;t interact with it.
the kindle is almost like this however it&apos;s screen has a too slow refresh rate
so it&apos;s a bit limited for interactive use.
and besides, even kindle&apos;s system is full of unnecessary stuff.
it runs linux which pretty much means it&apos;s full of unnecessary stuff.
</p>

<p>
my primary usecase for such a device would be writing and text editing.
so i definitely need a good keyboard as well.
phones and tables are out of question.
they have their place though: i think kindle is quite good for reading.
for keyboard it would be nice if it were splittable just like ergodox.
most ideal would be if the two halves could be snapped together to
act as a single keyboard like on ordinary laptops too.
the screen should be detachable too.
it should come with a small tall stand that i could put it on
so that i don&apos;t need to unnecessary hunch to use it
if i have access to a proper desk.
by detachable i don&apos;t mean wireless:
i don&apos;t mind having the screen and the keyboard wired.
</p>

<p>
as for the screen: i don&apos;t need colors.
i think my ideal screen would be those old monochrome lcd screens
that old calculators had.
those lasted quite long on very little battery.
and those worked quite nice in sunlight without any backlight too.
and i don&apos;t need a large resolution.
something like 640x480 or in that range would be more than enough.
hopefully this wouldn&apos;t drain much energy in general.
</p>

<p>
but still, what about the operating system and the cpu?
how could i have a very dumb system
but at the same time still have access to the modern world
of compilers, internet and so on?
i think this laptop needs two chips:
</p>

<ul><li>
  a microcontroller with very low power consumption
  that could run some in memory filesystem and a text editor.
  this microcontroller would run pretty much all the time.
</li><li>
  a full blown mini-computer (e.g. raspberry pi zero w).
  this would be mostly off but i can occassionally turn it on to
  sync my edits to disk, run a compilation and get back the results,
  or simply fetch my email from internet.
  ideally it would also have a 4g modem,
  so that the device would be internet enabled.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think this dual system could work quite perfectly.
using a dumb microcontroller for the primary interface means
that you can really minimize all the unnecessary stuff to a bare minimum
without needing to deal with the complexities of a full modern system.
and ideally this microcontroller wouldn&apos;t consume lot of energy,
nor would the keyboard or the screen,
so i could easily use this device for a long time.
sure, the text editor would have limited features, but that&apos;s fine.
i don&apos;t even need wrapping support thanks to my semantic break style.
</p>

<p>
i could even code like this.
for instance i&apos;d implement some big function.
then i&apos;d activate the mini computer.
the linux on it would quickly boot up,
write my in-memory edits to disk,
call the compiler and write its error messages back to another in-memory file,
and then simply turn itself off.
now i can fix all those errors one by one
without running the full computer, without draining the battery.
once i&apos;m happy with the changes,
i can turn the machine back on to compile again and
maybe push the changes to, say, github.
ideally the microcontroller would be programmable,
so, for example, i should be able to run a light c syntax checker on it
to save me activating the full computer before i fixed all the dumb errors.
</p>

<p>
even email reading would be quite nice (assuming people do plaintext emails).
the process would be this: turn on the mini computer,
it fetches the emails and writes them to the in-memory fs,
and then it turns itself off.
now i can read them at my pleasure, maybe even prepare some responses.
</p>

<p>
and since the battery could last for weeks
maybe i could go into the woods for a week long fasting retreat
into a forest or onto a boat for maximum silence
and this little device (along with a kindle)
could keep me quite entertained without the need of a big energy source.
</p>

<p>
and i suspect it wouldn&apos;t be too complicated to build such a device.
maybe one could hack it together with some preexisting components.
but to be fair, i don&apos;t have any hardware experience,
and i don&apos;t really have a big need for such a device
(i&apos;m not mobile -- i spend almost all my life sitting at home)
so i&apos;m unlikely to ever attempt to create such a device.
i&apos;m just saying it would be nice if it existed.
</p>

<h2 id="optioning">optioning</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>another way to have interesting conversations.</p>
<p>
i&apos;m really bad in conversations.
in real life i tend to be too silent and superficial.
in emails i tend to write too much, sometimes being too insensitive.
i&apos;m pretty sure i often overwhelm the recipient with the quantity
because i often don&apos;t get any replies.
and my writing style is not very coherent,
i just keep rambling about random stuff.
reading my writing is probably quite hard.
and often people don&apos;t even like to write,
so then i&apos;m having hard time to communicate with such people.
</p>

<p>
i think there are two big problems with my art of communication.
the quantity problem: i&apos;m tempted to ask too many questions.
it&apos;s pretty much infeasible to answer them all in one message.
and even if you were able to do, you have to go question by question
which makes the email to have a very unnatural format.
</p>

<p>
then there&apos;s the quality problem:
some of the questions are very hard, that nobody knows the answers to.
the recipient has no idea how to respond to such a question,
and as such is very discouraged from responding at all.
</p>

<p>
i think i found a way to address both issues.
rather than asking all the questions in one letter,
i focus on asking a single question.
if i have more, then i might start tracking the list of questions or topics
that needs further discourse, and simply ask them at a later point.
furthermore i also provide 2-4 answer options
and the recipient simply must choose the least wrong answer
with an optional comment.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t think one needs to obsess about the answer quality
since the expectation is to choose the least wrong.
i&apos;d expect people would mention a better answer if they have in the comment.
the point is to force people to make a decision.
in case of indecisive people
you can pretty much bypass the indecisive consciousness
and get an answer right from the subconsciousness.
for your email partner the whole thing is like
one of those conversational adventure games
(e.g. telltale&apos;s walking dead or life is strange).
</p>

<p>
however the downside is that this is much harder on the questioner.
they really need to think a lot what single question would be the one
that uncovers the most information for them about the other person.
it&apos;s an intriguing puzzle game.
it&apos;s somewhat similar to debugging computer programs.
but here you are debugging humans.
you create several hypotheses
and the other person tells you which one is the closest.
or it&apos;s like that &quot;hot and cold&quot; kid game
where you hide something and the kid has to find it
with you converting their distance from it into temperatures.
</p>

<p>
(edit: to generate good answers,
the questioner needs to put themselves in to the answerer&apos;s shoes.
they questioner must see the question from the answerer&apos;s perspective.
i think this can bring a lot of clarity to the questioner,
and thus gives a big boost to feeling empathetic to the other person.)
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s a very slow process but if one has patience
and the other person is willing to play this honestly,
i think one can learn quite a lot of deep things about the other person.
and it&apos;s very easy to start.
you start with something like &quot;how are you these days? good/bad&quot;
and then the rest of the questions sort of give themselves.
e.g. &quot;what makes you happy/sad these days?&quot; for the above one.
if unsure, you can always ask &quot;why?&quot; for the previous answer
and try to come up with some realistic answers to it.
</p>

<p>
i think it&apos;s important to play this over email rather than instant messaging.
sometimes it might take several days
to come up with the next question or even with the answer.
email supports labeling and threading by default
so it&apos;s the best medium for slow communication.
</p>

<p>
such a discussion could be almost neverending.
however given the fact that one could go at it very slowly,
that shouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem.
one could easily talk like that with multiple people
if they are not bothered by the fact that the delays
between the individual messages with a given person will keep growing.
also, if you have lots of questions that you want to ask a single person,
you could have multiple parallel threads with them.
though i&apos;d expect that could be quite strenuous to maintain.
</p>

<p>
to give a small taste how this could look like,
i&apos;ve created a demo about this at /dialog.
it&apos;s just a dumb dialog tree.
it obviously cannot have as much nuance as a realtime conversation could have.
but it was quite fun to write it.
it was quite tiring to write it though so therefore it&apos;s very short.
</p>

<p>
btw, this idea could take many other forms.
for instance that dialog tree from above could be a collaboratively edited one,
implemented similarly like a wiki.
that way it could grow quite big.
with some sort of trusted peer review it could stay quite sensible.
or one could make an app for it,
that keeps asking you questions very slowly.
and then its developer just keep adding new nodes based on the stats
where the most people are stuck currently.
the developer&apos;s goal would be
to split people along the nodes as much as possible.
or maybe one could make a live tv interview show
where the host comes up with good questions
that both the viewers and the interviewee tries to answer.
first the interviewee tries to guess the viewers response,
and then analyze those results.
i think this could give a good insight how someone thinks
since they have to put themselves into other people&apos;s shoes.
the socractic method has similarities to this method too.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m not sure what the name of this technique would be.
i went with &quot;optioning&quot;
since the primary task is to give options to the other person.
</p>

<p>
anyways, at least i now have a new technique in my toolset,
maybe i&apos;ll use it one day too.
</p>

<h2 id="grow">grow</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>thoughts about mentoring and schools.</p>
<p>
i feel that there&apos;s still a lot of undereducation, even illiteracy in places
where things should really be much better.
it seems to me that there are people
who are not that interested in education and the more civilized way of life
which in turn leads to another generation of theirs with the same qualities.
often these people have completely different culture and lifestyle
compared to the traditional western people.
the traditional education experience simply doesn&apos;t work for them
which is a loss for both them and everyone else in the society.
</p>

<p>
by &quot;traditional education&quot; i mean something where kids go to school,
passively learn a fixed curriculum for about 6 hours a day
(they sit at their little desks and listen to the teacher all day long),
and then get examined and so on.
people then keep repeating classes until they get a passing grade,
or get bored of the school and simply don&apos;t go anymore.
usually such classes contain a lot of people
which causes problems around managing the classroom
and around the boredom and the pacing of the material.
</p>

<p>
every person develops at a different pace, has different interests,
needs different environment for effective learning,
needs different psychological support to make sense of the world.
i think the traditional one size for all system
doesn&apos;t really scale well to diverse groups.
</p>

<p>
we also need to acknowledge that not everyone wants to be a doctor,
engineer, professor, or something other that needs high education.
some people just want to stay at home (e.g. to raise kids)
or just have some simple non-demanding job that allows them a comfortable life.
given the technological prowess the world has,
it should probably be fine to not work at all.
</p>

<p>
i think the only things that everyone should know are the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  reading
</li><li>
  writing (both handwriting and typing on the computer)
</li><li>
  basic math skills (e.g. addition so that they can work with money)
</li><li>
  how to ask for help (e.g. googling, going to doctors, speaking up)
</li><li>
  purpose and techniques of learning, science and life in general
</li><li>
  ethics, courtesy and some other basic life and social skills
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think that&apos;s about it what we should universally expect from all the people.
anything on top of that should be at the person&apos;s own discretion.
most of the above cannot be tested with standardized tests.
(standardized tests are dumb on many levels but i don&apos;t want to get into that.)
in fact there&apos;s no standardized way to teach all of the above,
each person would need unique attention over many years
to ensure achieving all of the above.
</p>

<p>
in order to achieve that, i think each kid needs a mentor
who will appropriately challenge the kid and ensure their growth.
we usually expect that the teachers do this for us
but that doesn&apos;t really scale for most schools.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d make &quot;mentor&quot; an officially acknowledged title that people can wear.
and i&apos;d allow anyone to become a mentor after some short training.
so if you are a bored stay at home mom,
then you could sign up to mentor a few kids around the block
(you could mentor your own kids but if the kids have a problem with you
then you are robbing them from a truly 3rd party, neutral help.)
</p>

<p>
the mentor&apos;s task would be to ensure regular reflection in people.
one can even formalize this.
i&apos;d expect that the mentor and the mentee would create a document together
on a regular timeframe (no more than 5 months)
that has a short answer to these prompts:
</p>

<ul><li>

<p>
even a sentence&apos;s worth of answer is enough.
the point here is to ask the question so that it triggers the reflection.
this can prevent people going on autopilot all the time.
</p>

<p>
the last prompt about other people is for the mentor
to solicit feedback about the mentee from other people
at their own leisure time.
this is to ensure that the various bubble and bias effects are somewhat smaller.
</p>

<p>
the answers to these questions would be relatively private.
however to ensure accountability,
the mentors would need to occasionally report to some mentor managers.
these managers would be well experienced mentors
that know what to look for and how to improve mentoring
so they would review these answers for their reports.
this means the mentor&apos;s manager would also have access to the answers.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d mandate everyone to have a mentor
and to have such reflection documents written regularly.
the nice thing about anybody easily becoming a mentor is
that each mentee can then easily find a culturally similar mentor
who has then a much higher chance to really connect with the mentee.
(one of the ongoing expectations of the mentors would be
to find a better mentor for the mentee if possible.
mentor managers could help a lot with this.)
</p>

<p>
the mentor and mentees would regularly meet (e.g. weekly even).
it doesn&apos;t have to be a formal meeting.
they might go for a walk, coffee, gym, videogame arcade,
whatever that really makes it easy to talk for the people.
mentee would then tell about their ongoing struggles
and the mentor would then challenge the mentee to overcome them
and perhaps intervene or help out if the mentee has too large problems.
the mentor can also suggest new things to try
if the mentee is not sure what to do.
</p>

<p>
such mentorship shouldn&apos;t necessarily end at 18 years old.
in fact this should be a lifelong thing.
each citizen should have access to a neutral mentor
(so ideally somebody with whom you have no conflict of interest with any topic).
i&apos;m not saying this should be mandatory, just a civil right.
i mean government (or something) should ensure an active network
of freely available mentors for consultation.
stuff like this might already exists (e.g. in the form of self organized groups)
but it can be quite hard to find and consider such things
if you had never been exposed to such things before
(and this is why i&apos;d make it mandatory for teenagers at least).
</p>

<p>
now back to education.
thanks to all the technological advancements
a lot of new options have opened up when it comes to education.
for instance we no longer need traditional lectures.
people wanting lectures can just watch videos on the internet instead.
and some of those videos (e.g. khan academy stuff)
is much better quality than your average teacher could ever do
whilst trying to maintain order in a classroom.
learners can pause, rewind, alter the speed of such videos
which makes it much easier to follow the content.
</p>

<p>
this doesn&apos;t eliminate the classrooms though.
i think classrooms are still good for practicing together,
asking questions, clearing up uncertainties about a certain topic.
sometimes you don&apos;t even need a teacher,
a group of similarly interested students can just get together
and help each other understand some study materials.
</p>

<p>
so this means that schools would continue to exist
and students can go there to learn all sorts of things.
but what you learn there is mostly up to you.
it is your mentor who nudges you to pick up interesting stuff
and some stuff outside from your comfort zone too.
it should be fine to not study anything
and just play table tennis or to wrestle with others all day long too.
the important point here is to ensure everyone can find something here
that can occupy them rather than leaving people unsupervised
and then having them go on some antisocial rampage.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d imagine that such schools could start when the kids become teenagers
and until that time
a somewhat less organized kindergarten like environment would be enough.
however smarter kids could easily go earlier to a school like that
if they feel like ready.
i wouldn&apos;t put an upper age limit how long can people stay there.
it should be possible even for adults to go back and learn with kids
if they wish so.
not sure how weird that would be.
</p>

<p>
i wouldn&apos;t give mandatory tests to the kids here.
however it should be possible for the kids to have 1:1s with the teachers
where the teacher tries to figure out the weaknesses of the kid.
this wouldn&apos;t be graded and it would be solely for the kid&apos;s own development.
</p>

<p>
i think all sorts of kids could thrive here.
the smart kid who simply soaks everything could just take all the modules.
the one kid who has interest in one topic only and zones out on everything else
can just learn that single topic and perhaps occasionally read about
or listen to other topics on a mentor&apos;s prompt.
the student who has no interest in learning or is antisocial:
such kids usually don&apos;t thrive in traditional schools.
at least in a place like this they might slowly learn to control their impulses
if nothing else rather than let them develop uncontrollably.
</p>

<p>
in the old days teachers could simply use physical force
to intimidate people into compliance.
this might have given the illusion that schools worked better in the past.
students these days know their rights very much
so teachers need more subtle ways to make the school a nice place.
i think people just need real good, personal guidance
and that&apos;s why i talked so much about mentoring above.
</p>

<p>
i think schools like this already exist
even with some mentoring (e.g. budapest school, i believe)
but they aren&apos;t very mainstream.
but i think all schools will slowly evolve in this direction over time.
kids these days can already take lectures from internet.
lectures can become the &quot;homework&quot;
and classrooms can become more interactive practice or discussions groups
if they haven&apos;t already.
thanks to all instantaneous communication, calendar and scheduling software
a school can decide for more flexible classroom schedules
so kids can have more freedom to rearrange their week as they see fit.
there&apos;s no need to centrally plan it all.
this also opens up possibilties for the schools to provide more optional courses
and kids can then focus more on their areas of interest.
</p>

<p>
in general i&apos;m quite optimistic about the education in the future.
but i expect the above changes will come only after a generation or two:
the world is different than what it was when i grew up.
to fully embrace it, i think you need people who were grown up in it.
that&apos;s why i expect that all we need to do is to wait
until the today&apos;s younglings start leading schools in the future.
</p>

<h2 id="reflecting">reflecting</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>reflect regularly!</p>
<p>
one thought stuck with me from my previous post, /grow.
in there i propose that one should occasionally write answers to 4 questions.
to recap, let me list those 4 questions along with a single word
that summarizes the question&apos;s intent:
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement:
  what achievement of yours are you the most proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  failure: what are you not so proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  goal: name a goal for the next few months.
</li><li>
  peers: name a few people who you interacted with a lot in the past few months.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think these are pretty good questions:
they don&apos;t overwhelm you because they only ask you to list one answer.
even answering with one short sentence is enough.
and just because you list at least one answer,
it already bumps you out of a fully autopilot life.
</p>

<p>
in that post i suggest
that people work on these questions regularly with a mentor.
however what if someone doesn&apos;t have a mentor?
well, i think one should still ask those questions from themselves regularly.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll give it a shot every 4 months or so.
i tried answering those questions and they are not that easy.
as an example here&apos;s what i came up with yesterday after some pondering
(keep in mind that the answers are about the surrounding +/- 4 months):
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement: i&apos;ve created a good daily routine.
</li><li>
  failure: i still distracted myself too often with pointless internet surfing.
</li><li>
  goal: find an accountability partner to grow my peer list.
</li><li>
  peers: ak (initials only)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it took me a while to answer those questions
but now i feel i have a bit more clarity about where i am and where am i going.
although i&apos;ll try to do this regularly but probably i won&apos;t do it publicly.
i feel doing it publicly would prevent being fully honest with the answers.
the answers could often require a lot of personal context
that would just not make sense without that extra knowledge.
e.g. my &quot;goal&quot; has more nuance to it that i didn&apos;t elaborate above.
or one might not want to publicize their failures and aspirations.
though i might change my mind and i&apos;ll just keep updating this post
or add a new post for every reflection point even if things don&apos;t make sense.
</p>

<p>
note that this reflection doesn&apos;t necessary come with any commitments.
for instance i can now decide
how disturbing the procrastination mentioned in the failure question is.
if it is, i might start tracking it or try to prevent it.
or i might just make a mental note of it (raise mental awareness)
and see how it changes over time.
furthermore, i might make plans to achieve my goal or i might not.
but i can certainly give it an occasional thought
how could i come nearer the goal.
</p>

<p>
doing it every 4 months means 3 reflection points in a year.
i find that not too frequent and not too rare:
it&apos;s just 4 questions that need single sentence answer after all.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll be able to tell if this is valuable or not
after i did it a few times and have some historical data.
so maybe after a year or two i&apos;ll know.
it&apos;s a cheap experiment to try.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  2021-05 (4 months update)
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement: quite enjoyed work lately, felt productive, got good rating.
</li><li>
  failure: some stuff almost happened,
  but actually no progress on accountability partner front.
  starting to doubt i actually need this.
</li><li>
  goal: try out a very specific new hobby
  that might replace my need for the accountabilty partner.
</li><li>
  peers: ak

</ul>

<h2 id="seennet">seennet</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>an idea for a social networking site around videocalling.</p>
<p>
i think i like the idea of having community sites with very specific rules.
so here&apos;s one idea that i think is optimized for &quot;meeting&quot; people.
by &quot;meeting&quot; i mean a 10 minute-ish videocall.
this would be a social networking site
where you could interact with others only through videocalls.
</p>

<p>
there are sites like omegle and chatroulette
where you can talk with strangers.
the problem with them is
that you don&apos;t really control what happens after the chat:
you might feel the whole chat was in vain
when a good call ended before exchanging contact data.
</p>

<p>
in seennet you can access a person&apos;s profile only after you&apos;ve met them
and as long as both parties agree to this in a short post-call survey.
after getting the consent from both sides, you would become &quot;friends&quot;.
you would have to regularly meet to maintain the relationship
otherwise seennet would break the connection (e.g. after 18 months).
</p>

<p>
in order to use the site, all you need to configure are the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  your availability for scheduling the meeting events (e.g. mornings),
</li><li>
  your language filters (e.g. you only speak english and german),
</li><li>
  optional geographical filters (e.g. only local people).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
then you would ask seennet to schedule you some videocalls.
</p>

<p>
simply chatting randomly could be boring and pointless.
therefore i&apos;d add a little gamification to all this:
another goal on the site would be to &quot;suggest arrangements&quot;.
suppose you know quite a lot of people
and you know a friend of yours would get along
with another friend of yours very well but they don&apos;t know each other yet.
then you enter this suggestion into the system along with a note
that explains why they might like each other
(e.g. you can mention that they both have the same secret hobby).
then if seennet ever schedules a meeting for them
they both see your note before the meeting
so they know that they have a common friend.
that means they are not so stranger after all
and given the recommendation they have a good chance for connecting well.
</p>

<p>
you could compare this system with online dating sites.
there you create an online profile, add photos, list interests.
then you need to message a lot of people
or hope that the right person messages you.
if you are introvert who is into introverts
then the latter strategy might never connect you up with the ideal partner.
you have to invest a lot of energy into this system.
in seennet you simply need to show up regularly
and after a while you&apos;ll start meeting more like minded people
without any reliance on any fancy algorithm doing the right thing.
</p>

<p>
in those dating sites a lot can matter on your profile.
in seennet you re-present your profile every time you meet a new person.
the first few minutes of your introduction is your &quot;profile&quot;, basically.
the nice thing about this is that your live &quot;profile&quot; can improve over time
because you get constant feedback about it
as you see the other people&apos;s reactions.
you might not be so keen on improving your profile page
simply because you have no idea what effect it has on people.
</p>

<p>
i think this sort of thing could bring together people with many interests
not just romantic partners.
maybe you are into learning german.
every time you introduce yourself,
you also tell people that you want to practice german.
maybe the other person knows someone who also studies german.
they can then add a recommendation with a note like this:
&quot;you both like hiking, want to practice german. you should meet!&quot;.
i think there&apos;s less awkwardness with this sort of introductions
compared to a meeting with a complete stranger.
here at least a friend vouched for the other person,
so you should be a bit of at an ease here.
and you also have a common topic already,
no need to spend a lot of time trying to find it.
</p>

<p>
another weird example could be nudity.
i think it was quite common on chatroulette in its early times
and it was usually unwanted by most people.
on seennet you would initially appear on the calls clothed
but you would mention that you like nude calls.
(being clothed in the random calls could be a rule).
if a person knows two people who like being nude
they can arrange a call between them
and the suggestion note could say:
&quot;you both want to be nude. have a nude chat!&quot;.
then you would have the opportunity to go wild with strangers.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s another psychological aspect here:
you can express your weird wishes in an indirect way.
in a traditional site with direct connections only
you would mostly only experience rejection
since the goal is to connect to the other matched person directly.
but in seennet your only goal is to listen and note the desires
so that you can connect people together.
i think the fear of rejection would diminish on a site like this
since the other person doesn&apos;t really have to like you
in order to still rake in virtual points for successful matching.
</p>

<p>
i think the underlying idea behind seennet is very generic
and can easily adapt to a wider range of interests
than what typical sites usually have.
for instance maybe you are a couple
and looking for another couple to play boardgames (or other fun).
</p>

<p>
you could easily register a &quot;couple&quot; profile
and appear as a couple on all videocalls.
solo people might mention this couple in their other calls
and if there are other people who are interested in some couple fun
they could then also register as a couple.
that solo person can then arrange a meeting between them.
in fact a couple based subculture might appear on the site
even without any specialcasing done on the site itself.
</p>

<p>
i wouldn&apos;t allow any messaging on this platform, only videocalls.
if you want messaging, just connect on some other platform.
i think this limitation would keep things simpler and cleaner.
</p>

<p>
but what would motivate members to keep suggesting connections?
i&apos;d make things a bit more complicated for this.
you&apos;ll see when somebody suggests you a connection
but this in itself won&apos;t increase the odds
that seennet schedules the suggested meeting for you.
in order for it to do that you&apos;d need to &quot;accept&quot; the suggestion.
that would increase the odds
that seennet schedules its random calls with that person.
simply increasing the odds i think is a good defense against spam suggestions.
however if the other side also accepts the suggestion
seennet pretty much immediately schedules the meeting
or tells you that you have a calendar mismatch.
</p>

<p>
the trick is in the &quot;accepting&quot;.
you can&apos;t accept a connection unless you suggest one before.
so basically the site has a currency.
you get credit for suggesting.
maybe also for someone accepting your suggestions.
and accepting suggestions uses up such credit.
to limit spam, i&apos;d only allow suggesting one connection per day.
</p>

<p>
the assumption i&apos;m making here is
that people would feel a strong urge to accept suggestions
since that&apos;s how they can find nice friends.
and this urge will then drive them to suggest connections for others.
</p>

<p>
given that you can only establish new connections
through the random or suggested calls,
one would be quite invested into their profile.
creating a new profile wouldn&apos;t give you much
since it would take a while to build up a larger network
that you could spam effectively.
so i think the spam would be somewhat reduced on the site intrinsically.
people would be motivated to adhere to the rules
otherwise they have a lot to lose (i.e. their network).
</p>

<p>
another benefit of using such a site is
that it takes control of &quot;maintaining&quot; the connections.
i&apos;m really bad at this in real life:
if somebody doesn&apos;t call or write to me then i don&apos;t reach out to them.
for one, i feel shy and feel that i would be disturbing them
if i asked how are things with them.
two, i know that such talking usually starts at and often ends at small talk.
and i&apos;m really bad and uncomfortable at small talk
so i simply avoid it if i can.
but if some entity randomly schedules some videocalls 
then it might help me take care of the anxieties
and the scheduling work around this.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve chosen short online videocalls
because they can fit the modern schedule easier
and give access to many people very conveniently.
i&apos;m sure such things exist in offline world too:
e.g. i think there are apps that arrange lunch mates for you
so you don&apos;t have to eat alone.
in such places arranging dates with others might come less naturally
so that&apos;s why a little gamified site around this could help.
also, lunching can be expensive from both time and money perspective,
hence i think i&apos;d prefer the low cost videocalls.
but i still would want to do it with local people
and that&apos;s why i&apos;d add the option for geographic filtering into the settings.
</p>

<p>
i came to this peer powered matchmaking site idea
while reading fowler&apos;s book called &quot;connected&quot;.
that book talks about social networks/graphs in general.
i really liked the &quot;friend of a friend&quot; aspect:
the number of people you are connected through a friend is quite large.
and your friend often connects you to another of their friend
if they seem that such a friendship would be beneficial.
in fact, this is how a lot of romantic relationships get arranged.
so then i thought how could one build a network around this
and maybe nudge people a little bit to be more active in suggesting.
the above is what i came up with.
</p>

<p>
and these days it&apos;s pretty easy to set up videocalls between people
using all the browser apis.
so i think the implementation of such a site would be relatively simple.
although i&apos;m somewhat unsure if peer-to-peer videocalls should be allowed
or if the videocalls should go through a central server.
i don&apos;t know how bad it is to leak ip addresses these days.
alternatively i&apos;m sure one could use jitsi for this one way or another.
</p>

<p>
if such a site would exist, i might try it.
maybe one day in my distant retirement i might build it
if i still want it and it doesn&apos;t exist yet.
</p>

<h2 id="solomove">solomove</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>doing the same exercise throghout the day over and over again.</p>
<p>
i&apos;m quite the passive person.
i pretty much sit all day long in front of my computer at home.
but then there&apos;s everybody saying that some exercising is important.
</p>

<p>
a while ago i thought about how could i trick myself into some exercising.
my goal was not to develop proper exercise routine
just to avoid the absolutely zero exercise living.
i found a way that worked for a while.
i wrote about this in /enacc.
skim that, otherwise some of the things here won&apos;t make sense.
</p>

<p>
i eventually stopped caring about decrementing the enacc energy
because i stopped procrastinating much.
enacc wasn&apos;t the thing that stopped me from procrastinating.
what stopped my bad habits was rather the improved daily routine.
</p>

<p>
nevertheless i tried working on incrementing the energy levels via exercising.
i tried to keep it level across all exercise dimensions.
which means i eventually started doing the exercises in a round robin fashion.
i always pretty much knew which exercise to do at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
i usually stayed on a single exercise until i hit a switch point
at which i started focusing on the next exercise.
the switch point was at every 50 points.
e.g. if all exercises are at 250 points
then i start doing the first one until 300 points,
and then switch to the next exercise.
i don&apos;t do this in a single set.
i usually accumulate 50 points over many sets over several days.
i mostly focused on them in the morning,
since exercise can be a part of the morning routine.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  problem
</p>

<p>
eventually i started dreading the system a little bit.
my problem was the same what i&apos;ve had previously when i tried going to a gym.
i felt it requires too much time investment from me
and i don&apos;t particularly enjoy myself during the exercise.
</p>

<p>
and as i was doing the exercises themselves,
i felt that i focus too much solely on counting the repetitions.
i counted so that i knew my strength
and in order to enter the progress into enacc.
but in the end i felt i did it for the numbers rather than for myself.
i felt the &quot;tyranny of metrics&quot;.
the whole thing felt pointless.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  requirements
</p>

<p>
i really liked one part: enacc always told me what to do.
it&apos;s almost like as if a personal trainer takes care of the &quot;thinking&quot;.
but then i thought, maybe a personal trainer could take of the counting too?
or furthermore: what if i don&apos;t care about counting at all?
do i lose anything?
</p>

<p>
basically here&apos;s what i want:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i don&apos;t need to think or track things during the exercise or in general.
</li><li>
  it requires very little time investment from me.
</li><li>
  something that tells me what to do.
</li><li>
  the exercises should be simple and varied.
</li><li>
  but within a day the exercise pretty much stays the same.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i added the static exercise requirement because i started liking the simplicity
of doing only a single exercise per day from my enacc experience.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  solution
</p>

<p>
i think i managed to come up with a new system that seems to work for me.
i write up the list of exercises to do:
pushups, pullups, squats, dips, bench presses, etc.
then each day i pick a single exercise
and only do that through many small sets throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
i order the exercises into a least recently used list.
then every day i just pop the least recently used exercise
and that will be my exercise for the day.
i then put that exercise to the end of the list.
i also track the date i last used an exercise for reference
but that is not really important.
</p>

<p>
this system tells me what to do for each day.
whenever i decide to do a set, i just do however much i feel like doing.
i don&apos;t track the rep count or the length the exercise because i no longer care.
i don&apos;t particularly feel dread anymore because if i feel i did too little
then i promise to myself that the next set will be harder.
and sometimes it is, sometimes it&apos;s not.
the point is not to have a proper exercise routine
just to avoid the absolutely zero exercise days.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  amount
</p>

<p>
i try to do the exercises in a way that they are hard
and i can&apos;t really do more than, say, 10 reps.
this doesn&apos;t always work because one gets stronger over time.
one learns to do more reps and then needs longer time to get to the amount
that hits the limits of the muscles.
but e.g. i try to do squats while holding weights to make it harder.
</p>

<p>
an ideal set is where i do the exercise until my muscles give up.
and even then a couple more negative versions of the exercise
(e.g. in pullups a negative is when you slowly lower yourself).
iiuc negative exercises are the new hotness, just search for it.
but unfortunately i often give up sooner than i reach this part.
</p>

<p>
in exchange one should do sets all the time throughout the day.
i try to do a few sets in the morning already.
if i don&apos;t forget i do try to do them throughout the day too
but i don&apos;t obsess about it.
if i forget then so be it.
at least i did some in the morning.
</p>

<p>
another thing i find helpful is to do the exercises very slowly.
i find this uses more muscle power
and is actually more closer to the negative exercises.
but i don&apos;t obsess about this either.
sometimes i do things faster, sometimes slower, depending on my mood.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  soreness
</p>

<p>
muscle soreness is my feedback about whether i did something good or not.
if i don&apos;t get sore muscles then it means
i did either too little or the exercise had a way too weak form.
i actually quite enjoy the pain that comes from this
because i learned to associate it with the fact that i did good.
now i actually miss it when i don&apos;t get sore.
so my actual goal is to be sore all the time.
</p>

<p>
i watched a lot of dragon ball z as i was a kid.
and the most important thing i learned from it: no pain no gain.
the heroes got powerful through a lot of pain.
so that show educated me that pain is fine.
</p>

<p>
but i do give myself a free pass for the day if i feel soreness.
iiuc your muscles have to heal, so it&apos;s better to avoid training.
my conscience is still in the clear when i avoid exercise such days.
though if it&apos;s only my legs sore
then i might still pick some upper body exercises to do.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  review
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m using this system for the past few days and i really like it.
it really makes the exercise easy: i don&apos;t really have to think about it.
whenever i&apos;m between things, i stand up and try to do a set if i remember it.
</p>

<p>
and i don&apos;t set any expectations for myself about the sets.
if it&apos;s small, then it&apos;s small.
it really helps me to actually start the exercise
if i know it won&apos;t take too long.
sometimes i still count during it
because counting can make me push harder those last few reps.
sometimes i don&apos;t, and i&apos;ll try to think about something during it.
or sometimes i do it to clear my head:
like in meditation, i try to focus on simply feeling the pain.
and there&apos;s lot to feel once you are at your limits.
</p>

<p>
sometimes (usually?) i don&apos;t get sore muscles the next day.
but that&apos;s fine, i&apos;ll remember that
and maybe i&apos;ll do the same exercise harder or differently next time.
</p>

<p>
i like the least recently used list thing too.
i even added other things to it to remember doing regularly, e.g. cold showers.
i started to end my showers with turning the water to as cold as possible
and have a totally cold shower for a few seconds.
i can&apos;t really last longer than a few seconds.
cold water is painful too but i very much like the feeling right after.
maybe with some exposure i can increase my tolerance over time.
it&apos;s like a form of mental training to learn to endure pain.
but in order to not forget about this habit,
i put it into my lru list to make sure i&apos;m regularly reminded to do it.
i can totally imagine that i might put other things into it over time.
</p>

<p>
one downside of this system is that it really only works from home.
once i need to go back to the office, it&apos;s likely i might stop.
but since i wake up quite early in the morning (i now aim at 5am),
i might still be able to do enough sets in the morning
so that i won&apos;t need to do them at work.
we&apos;ll see.
</p>

<p>
in any case, i&apos;ll keep experimenting with this system and see how it goes.

<h2 id="phones">phones</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>thoughts about phones now that i have to buy a new one.</p>
<p>
this year (2021) swisscom decided to shut down its 2g network.
i got no warning about this, my phone just suddenly stopped working.
it took me quite a while to guess that 2g might be gone
and then confirming in the news that it&apos;s indeed very likely.
apparently i might have been the only person in switzerland
who still used 2g phones.
to be fair, this is a corporate subscription
so maybe my workplace got a warning about this via snail mail.
it would have been nice to give a few days headsup via sms too though.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve switched to a dumbphone in 2015 after 1.5 years of using a smartphone.
i got my first smartphone (nexus4) from my workplace in 2013.
but it was quite addictive for me,
i was checking it way too often rather than being present in the world.
the constant updates were also super annoying.
almost as if every month there is some big os update
that takes ages to install and then it changes the user interface subtly enough
so that you can throw out some of your muscle memory all the time.
but what really pissed me up is that they break very quickly
and you are then expected to get a new phone.
after a year or so it started occassionally rebooting.
it even rebooted at night.
back then i had to have mandatory encryption due to corp policy
and you would need to enter your unlock pattern to boot.
this meant that on some nights it decided to reboot
then the next morning i got no alarm or page notifications at all
until i woke up naturally.
and i was pretty sure this was a software problem only present with wifi on,
but on support all i got that the phone is end of life, i should get a new one.
i really hate this planned obsolescence attitude
so i decided to get rid of smartphones from my life.
</p>

<p>
i had the first generation nokia 105 from 2013 that i bought in 2015.
it had none of the issues that i had with the smartphone.
i also felt that i got generally calmer.
this nokia aged quite well.
it still functioned well
although the letters/numbers from its keypad completely faded away.
i could type blind on this so this wasn&apos;t bothering me that much.
separate buttons would have been nice though.
later models had keypads like that.
anyways, i wanted a similar phone that would work with the new networks.
</p>

<p>
in the meantime i dusted off the new corporate pixel 4
that i got from the company last year when i moved to switzerland.
i only got it because i thought i&apos;ll need it for work (a special app)
but then it turned out i don&apos;t so i didn&apos;t use it
and couldn&apos;t be bothered to return it.
i&apos;ve put in the sim card and it worked fine.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve spent some time on this android to make it somewhat usable.
this entails removing all the unnecessary apps,
turning off unnecessary features (animations: what&apos;s the point of this?),
and other tweaks.
i&apos;ve disabled data and wifi, enabled battery saver.
basically i&apos;ve managed to turn it into a dumbphone.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about the old nokia that its battery lasted for weeks.
i thought all these fancy new phones can&apos;t last a day even.
i was quite surprised to learn that the pixel4 with the latest android
could probably last for a week even.
it drained only about 12-15% battery per day.
</p>

<p>
my phone usage other than to check the time is very light:
i only use it to set alarms for wakeup and for meeting reminders,
and some evenings i use its flashlight to see in the dark rather than lamps
because i don&apos;t want to accidentally wake my kid with the extra light.
secondary reason is to receive pages when i&apos;m oncall at work.
and on very rare occasions i also use the sms and calling features.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d wager that 99% of the time my phone is on standby.
it would be nice if i didn&apos;t need to mess around with chargers every day.
after learning the pixel4 can probably survive a week
i even considered just staying with it.
</p>

<p>
but there were a few things bothering me.
</p>

<p>
its size was much bigger than my old nokia.
it didn&apos;t fit as nicely into my pocket.
it felt quite bulky.
</p>

<p>
i missed the good old buttons.
there were mornings when i was trying to disable the morning alarm via swiping
and my swipes just didn&apos;t register.
and the alarm just got louder and louder (note: i&apos;m not living alone).
that was frustrating, let&apos;s say to the least.
in retrospect i learned
that i could have probably used the side buttons for this.
</p>

<p>
i do appreciate that a touchscreen is more generic interface,
but i prefer buttons.
i find them more reliable.
it happens often on various screens that my finger doesn&apos;t register,
especially when i&apos;m in a less than ideal conditions.
i might use the phone rarely but when i use it, i really need it to work.
i prefer reliability over &quot;usefulness&quot;.
in other words, i wish for a keypad.
</p>

<p>
the fact that pixel4 is a smartphone also bothered me for several reasons.
</p>

<p>
although i deleted all the apps from it,
it would be very trivial for me to reenable data
and start browsing crap when i feel uncomfortable at some place.
sure, i could probably resist this for quite a while
since i didn&apos;t associate internet with my phone for 6 years
but i&apos;m sure it would all come back over time.
i&apos;d very quickly adapt to it
and then couldn&apos;t live without it (e.g. to live without gps).
and i&apos;m also sure that if i&apos;d start using this more heavily
then it would start having problems like i had with the nexus4
(even if it&apos;s just the annoying updates in case the hardware remains good).
i can safe myself a lot of mental health
if i completely cut myself from this addiction device.
</p>

<p>
also, if it&apos;s a smartphone device and if others see it,
i feel that they will have different expectations from you.
they might expect that you are on whatsapp, messenger, viber, snapchat
or whatever today&apos;s messenger apps are.
while if all you have is a dumbphone,
they&apos;ll consider you as a weirdo and won&apos;t have much expectations from you.
it&apos;s a good conversation starter too
if you are hipster enough to flash it now and then in front of others.
</p>

<p>
besides, one needs to show a good example for the next generation:
that one doesn&apos;t need a smartphone to survive in society.
maybe this way i can somewhat delay my kid&apos;s smartphone addiction.
</p>

<p>
anyways, long story short: i still wanted an old fashioned dumbphone.
easy peasey, i say to myself:
let&apos;s check out nokia&apos;s newest models.
</p>

<p>
the newest nokia 105 (2019) can&apos;t do 3g or 4g.
but nokia 225 4g can!
it even has a camera.
i don&apos;t really need a camera but at least that is not that addictive
so that doesn&apos;t bother me too much.
i almost bought this on the spot but then i noticed one little detail
as i was comparing its specs with my old phone: the size.
</p>

<p>
here are the sizes of these 3 phones for reference:
</p>

<ul><li>
  107.0 x 44.8 x 14.3 mm: nokia 105 (2013)
</li><li>
  124.7 x 51.0 x 13.7 mm: nokia 225 4g (2020)
</li><li>
  147.1 x 68.8 x  8.2 mm: pixel 4 (2019)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the new phone i&apos;ve looked up is much much bigger!
this must be some weird model then, i thought.
but all the other phones grew too, even the new nokia 105 models:
</p>

<ul><li>
  119.0 x 49.2 x 14.4 mm: nokia 105 (2019)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
or compare my wife&apos;s very old dumbphone from her teenager times
with a new model of the same number:
</p>

<ul><li>
  108.8 x 46.2 x 11.7 mm: nokia 6303 classic (2009)
</li><li>
  131.4 x 53.0 x 13.7 mm: nokia 6300 4g (2020)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i recall from my childhood that the adults complained
about the phones getting way too small.
looks like in 2021 you can&apos;t get small phones anymore that are 3g/4g.
</p>

<p>
after researching a lot on the internet,
i&apos;ve found pretty much only these phones with comparable size of my old phone:
</p>

<ul><li>
  104.8 x 54.5 x 18.7 mm: nokia 2720 flip (2019); 192.7 mm when opened; kaios
</li><li>
   61.0 x 30.0 x 16.5 mm: zanco tiny t2 (2020); 3g dumbphone
</li><li>
   92.4 x 43.0 x 13.3 mm: unihertz jelly pro (2017); android 8
</li><li>
   95.9 x 55.9 x 8.79 mm: light phone ii (2019): &quot;light os&quot; (modified android)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
maybe there are more but these are the ones i found.
all of these phones support at least 3g and you can message too.
(i&apos;ve seen some phones which can only do calls but i ignored those.)
</p>

<p>
oh, and based on the specs and the reviews,
none of these phones can last for a week.
which is odd because nokia claims to work for 28 days in 3g mode, 20 in 4g,
yet 4 days is the longest duration i found in the customer reviews.
but it runs kaios so i guess that&apos;s a huge battery drain at this point.
i&apos;m sad that battery duration also became a lost art over time.
</p>

<p>
let me immediately eliminate the jelly pro:
it&apos;s a full smartphone and it comes with all the downsides.
besides, for some reason you can&apos;t easily update past android 8,
so it probably has worse battery management.
the reviews say it works for about a day.
(iirc battery management gets better with android versions.
i guess developers are slowly learning that not running the apps constantly
makes the battery last longer.
probably the newer android builds have longer sleep cycles.)
</p>

<p>
at this point i pretty much gave up on the battery front
and resolved to charging my phone every day.
so i decided battery shouldn&apos;t be deciding factor for me.
</p>

<p>
at first i was eyeballing the light phone.
it&apos;s an e-ink android phone that has a hardcoded dumbphone app running on it.
technically you can get to the underlying full android phone,
but it&apos;s a bit of a challenge and defeats the purpose of the phone anyways.
it has no flashlight and no buttons.
it&apos;s quite expensive too ($350).
and you&apos;d need to wait several months before they get another batch to ship.
with all this together it was easy for me to say no to this phone too.
</p>

<p>
i was then eyeing for that zanco phone.
there were a few things bothering me about it:
it might be too small and i&apos;m not sure about the quality:
in some video reviews i&apos;ve seen the reviewer struggling to press some buttons.
and i&apos;d have to order it from china
which means it would take ages to arrive and i&apos;d need to pay import taxes too.
oh and it doesn&apos;t have a flashlight.
</p>

<p>
and then there&apos;s that nokia 2720 flipphone.
it no longer uses nokia&apos;s standard dumbphone os but rather kaios.
kaios, iiuc, is like android but for phones with buttons.
it&apos;s a fork of mozilla&apos;s defunct firefox os.
basically the whole os is just a webbrowser running in a linux
and all the apps are just html5 pages.
this totally makes sense to me but the battery time worries me
because i don&apos;t really associate the web with efficiency.
and since it&apos;s all web based maybe it could run the addictive apps too.
but otherwise it does check okay on other dimensions:
has flashlight and buttons, doesn&apos;t look like a smartphone,
i can call and message with it.
it can even act as a wifi hotspot to share the mobile internet,
which i&apos;m not sure is good or not,
since then i can easily use a secondary device to browse internet anywhere.
but it&apos;s a bit too big for my taste:
bigger than my old nokia 105 even when closed.
i couldn&apos;t find a smaller phone though, so i can&apos;t be very picky.
</p>

<p>
btw, if the size didn&apos;t bother me that much,
i&apos;d have probably gone with energizer e241s.
it&apos;s also a kaios phone but the reviewers were happy with the battery life
and pretty much was the cheapest at the time (40 chf).
for reference the nokia2720 was 82 chf and the zanco $62 + shipping.
</p>

<p>
after contemplating a lot over my choices,
i realized that i can&apos;t make a good decision here.
all choices have some downsides.
i just need to pick one and go with it.
</p>

<p>
my wife suggested that i go with the nokia 2720, it&apos;ll be less hassle.
so i went with that.
i&apos;ll soon post a review of it.
you can look at /phones.jpg to see
how it compares to my other phones in terms of size and bulkiness.
</p>

<h2 id="nokia2720">nokia2720</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>tweaking and using the nokia 2720 kaios phone.</p>
<p>
as i described in /phones, i wanted a new non-smartphone.
so i decided to get a nokia 2720 4g (2019) flipphone.
i have a pic at /phones.jpg that shows
how it looks like in terms of size compared to my nokia 105 (2013)
which was made obsolete by the 2g network shutdown in my area
and pixel 4 that i used while i was waiting for the new phone.
as you can see, it&apos;s bigger than my old phone.
but that&apos;s still pretty much the smallest non-2g phone i found.
</p>

<p>
this phone runs kaios.
kaios is a linux that runs some old version of firefox
and all the apps on it are just html5 websites.
it&apos;s a fork of firefox os and is optimized for phones with keypads.
</p>

<p>
and as expected, by the default it comes with lots of quirks
that i needed quite some time to reconfigure.
fortunately it&apos;s relatively easy to tweak the phone
so at least that prevents one from getting unreasonably angry
about the &quot;design choices&quot; its developers have made.
</p>

<p>
let me document the tweaks i needed to make.
i&apos;ll try to be detailed
so that if i ever need to switch to another kaios phone,
i&apos;ll be able to set it up from scratch again.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s a site called bananahackers.
it&apos;s a collection of guides scraped from some kaios mailing list.
it&apos;s a bit annoying site but it was very useful for me to figure out things.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s quite a few hacks i did.
some are straight from bananahackers, some are my own findings:
</p>

<ul><li>
  deleted all crapware from it.
  it came with about 30 apps, i now have only 9 of them.
</li><li>
  enabled call recording.
</li><li>
  disabled answer on flip open.
</li><li>
  disabled the startup sound.
</li><li>
  made typing numbers faster.
</li><li>
  replaced my alarm clock sound.
</li><li>
  made the assistant button toggle the flashlight.
</li><li>
  removed the toaster notification when switching cases/t9.
</li><li>
  made the alarm clock time setting ui more usable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if you decide to go down this path then make sure you don&apos;t make a mistake.
it&apos;s very easy to mess up the whole phone and turn it into a brick.
i managed to make a mistake when editing the launcher&apos;s source
and the phone&apos;s ui got completely broken.
fortunately i could still start wallace-toolbox with gdeploy or webide
so i could reenable root and push a fix.
had i messed up the system app, then things would have been much harder.
</p>

<p>
note that all the patches below are against kaios 2.5.2.
an upgrade would probably invalidate most of my hacks
so i hope it won&apos;t come anytime soon.
although you can easily turn the updates down if needed.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  tweaking
</p>

<p>
so let&apos;s start.
i assume linux as your hacking device.
the tools you need are: adb and kaiosrt.
kaiosrt is basically just an old firefox that still has webide enabled.
you would use that to sideload apps to the phone
or to tweak some hidden settings.
alternatively you can use gdeploy to sideload apps.
i prefer the latter since you can easily run it from the command line.
software sources:
</p>

<ul><li>
  adb: get it from your linux distro&apos;s package manager.
</li><li>
  gdeploy: https://gitlab.com/suborg/gdeploy/ (needs npm)
</li><li>
  kaiosrt: https://developer.kaiostech.com/simulator/linux
</li><li>
  wallace-toolbox: https://gitlab.com/suborg/wallace-toolbox/
</li>
</ul>

<p>
enable debugging mode with &quot;*#*#33284#*#*&quot;.
a little bug icon should appear in the top status bar.
now connect the phone to your computer via its usb cable.
the device should appear when you run &quot;adb devices&quot;.
</p>

<p>
use gdeploy to install the wallace-toolbox app.
in that app you can enable call recording.
i&apos;ve enabled it because i have terrible hearing
and would prefer to listen back to some conversations
to ensure i picked up correctly everything.
the conversations will appear in a callrecording folder on its internal storage.
use mtp (e.g. mount it via go-mtpfs) to get to the folder when connected to it.
</p>

<p>
use wallace-toolbox to enable the developer menu.
this unlocks a new option in the settings (settings-&gt;device-&gt;developer)
where you can toggle the debug mode without needing to remember the code.
</p>

<p>
use wallace-toolbox to make all apps removable.
then you can use the right soft key in the launcher to bring up the menu
that will now contain an uninstall option for all apps.
i only kept these:
</p>

<ul><li>
  messages
</li><li>
  call log
</li><li>
  contacts
</li><li>
  camera
</li><li>
  gallery
</li><li>
  clock
</li><li>
  settings
</li><li>
  stk (sim toolkit): i&apos;d prefer to remove this one but it keeps reappearing.
</li><li>
  wallace toolbox
</li>
</ul>

<p>
that&apos;s 9 apps.
it fits one screen without scrolling so that&apos;s nice.
i think the rest is unneeded.
just use an actual computer to do the rest of the stuff
(e.g. browsing, gps, listening to recordings, radio, snake, etc).
</p>

<p>
use wallace-toolbox to enable adb root too.
after that &quot;adb shell&quot; will log you in as root
and you will be able to overwrite the builtin apps this way.
you&apos;ll need to enable this after each reboot
so maybe keep wallace-toolbox around
or somehow make this autoenabled on boot.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s one more easy setting you can do: disable the flip to answer.
i often want to reject a call so that i can call back immediately.
i&apos;m on a company paid plan with unlimited calls
so it&apos;s simply more cost effective for me to call back my wife.
for that i need to open my phone, reject the call, and then call back.
to set this up, start up kaiosrt and connect to the device.
in it go to runtime -&gt; device settings,
find the option phone.answer.flipopen.enabled and set it to false.
you might need to reboot.
i&apos;ve learned this one from the r/kaios subreddit.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  advanced tweaking + disabling the startup sound
</p>

<p>
all the system apps live at /system/b2g/webapps.
in order to replace some of them,
you need to copy the target app to /data/local/webapps
and point the app&apos;s dir to the new path.
to do that you need to edit /data/local/webapps/webapps.json
and change the target app&apos;s basePath property to /data/local/webapps.
</p>

<p>
let&apos;s start with the disabling the startup sound tweak to demo all this.
keep in mind that all the patches i show are against the formatted code.
just use a js formatter to reformat the files and then they are easy to edit.
i used clang-format with the google style but beware
clang-format seems to mess up code
where there&apos;s a missing semicolon at the end of the line.
by messing up i mean the code won&apos;t work anymore.
maybe apply the patches manually on the unformatted code directly.
</p>

<p>
to disable the startup sound, first grab the system app:
</p>

<pre>
  adb pull /system/b2g/webapps/system.gaiamobile.org
</pre>

<p>
a system.gaiamobile.org directory should appear in your current directory
and it should contain a file called application.zip.
it&apos;s best if you can edit the files right in the zip file
so that you don&apos;t need to unzip/rezip the contents.
modern distributions of vim can do this already
but probably other modern editors too.
</p>

<p>
apply this patch either manually or via patch:
</p>

<pre>
  diff -rpu base/system.gaiamobile.org/js/init_logo_handler.js mine/system.gaiamobile.org/js/init_logo_handler.js

<p>
i just pretty much completely disable the startOsLogoSound function&apos;s body.
after you made this change push this back to to the phone:
</p>

<pre>
  adb push system.gaiamobile.org /data/local/webapps
</pre>

<p>
notice that this time we are pushing to /data/local/webapps.
make sure to edit /data/local/webapps/webapps.json too:

  sed -i &apos;/system.gaiamobile.org/,/^  }/s:/system/b2g/webapps:/data/local/webapps:&apos; webapps.json
  adb push webapps.json /data/local/webapps/
</pre>

<p>
then reboot the phone for it to pick up the new system app:
</p>

<pre>
  adb reboot
</pre>

<p>
there shouldn&apos;t be any startup sound.
all changes below need a reboot in order for the phone to pick them up.
</p>

<p>
from now i&apos;ll just show the patches i used for the various tweaks.
make sure to pull and push each of the change the same way as the system app.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  type numbers faster
</p>

<p>
this tweak is from the bananahackers site.
basically if you want to type in a number while typing a message,
you can long press a button to make it a number.
but the duration is overly long so you can lower that like this:

  replace the alarm clock sound
</p>

<p>
i didn&apos;t find an option to use custom sounds for the alarm clock.
it&apos;s entirely possible i just missed an option for this.
but what i did is that i just replaced
</p>

<pre>
  clock.gaiamobile.org/shared/resources/media/alarms/ac_woody.ogg
</pre>

<p>
with a custom ogg file and pushed the clock app back to my phone.
</p>

<p>
i really hated the default selection.
i dislike alarms that suddenly scare me awake.
what i want is some white noise that gets louder slowly.
i downloaded some 1 minute rain mp3 from some sound sharing site,
opened it in audacity, applied a fade in effect over the whole sound,
exported it to ogg, and then put it into the clock&apos;s application.zip.
it worked just fine.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  make the assistant button toggle the flashlight
</p>

<p>
it baffles me that the &quot;assistant button&quot; is not configurable on this phone
and it defaults to that useless google assistant thingie
that i immediately deleted.
a much better use for that button would be to toggle the flashlight.
</p>

<p>
however i don&apos;t want the pressing itself to be the flashlight toggle.
i want to reserve that for checking the time.
i want to hold the button for a little while to toggle it.
i managed to set this up.
</p>

<p>
there is already some support in the code for holding down the button.
that&apos;s what triggers the assistant.
it needs a bit practice to get the hang of it though.
i think that&apos;s because of the phone&apos;s deep sleep mode.
the first time you press the button,
the code can&apos;t seem to be able to successfully set up any timers
or do any time related operations.
so the first time you press the button, you basically turn the phone up.
then the clock should now be visible on the external screen.
only now try to hold the button to toggle the flashlight.
if you omit the wakeup part, the holding won&apos;t work.
</p>

<p>
however there&apos;s also support for double tapping
which activates the same function as the holding.
at first i didn&apos;t disable the double tapping.
but then during daytime i sometimes noticed
that the flashlight was unexpectedly on.
that explained why on some days the battery drained faster than the rest.
this was quite a mystery for me but slowly i figured it out.
</p>

<p>
i often quickly check the time: i tap the button twice rapidly.
if it&apos;s daylight and this enables the flashlight, i simply won&apos;t notice.
furthermore, often it didn&apos;t enable the flashlight on the second tap.
it enabled it the next time i&apos;ve checked the time.
i think that&apos;s because the second tap enables the flash
and suspends the phone at the same time.
but the latter action happens sooner.
so the phone only enables the flash on the next wakeup
when i check the time next time.
this is not a problem with the holding
because the code enables the flash while you hold the button
and only suspends the phone after you release the button.
</p>

<p>
this bit of the code was quite tricky to get right.
most combinations of changing the existing code simply didn&apos;t work reliably.
in fact, the unmodified existing code didn&apos;t work reliably at all.
i&apos;m not sure what testing did people do on this.
this piece of code is also meant for handling the emergency sos calls
if you enable that in the accessibility settings.
but it simply doesn&apos;t work unless you tap + hold or tap like gazillion times
and hope that you manage trigger the code in the right manner.
to be fair, if you enable wifi/data and the phone never sleeps
then this is probably not a problem.
but make sure you don&apos;t trust your life to a kaios device in any case.
</p>

<p>
anyways what worked in the end was this:
on keydown, enable the external screen if it wasn&apos;t yet
and set up a timer to toggle the flashlight.
on keyup cancel the timer and turn off the screen
if we didn&apos;t turn it on with this button.
it took me quite a while to come up with this
but now it works quite reliably with the tap + hold pattern.
</p>

<p>
oh and i also changed the default timeout for holding from 3 seconds to 600 ms
because the former just felt too long.
</p>

<p>
here&apos;s the glorious patch.
note that it changes two system applications.

  remove the toaster notification when switching cases/t9
</p>

<p>
when typing a message,
you can press # to switch between T9, Abc, abc, ABC, 123 input modes.
the current mode is always displayed in the status bar.
however when you switch
a slow &quot;toaster&quot; popup drops down from the top
and is displayed for about a second showing the new mode.
if you want to switch rapidly between modes
then you simply don&apos;t know what the current mode is
because this silly popup keeps hiding the actual state.
i found a way to remove this redundant popup:

  made the alarm clock time setting ui more usable.
</p>

<p>
the time entry in the alarm clock app is quite weird.
what i&apos;d prefer is that i press &quot;1234&quot; to set an alarm for 12:34.
instead, i need to press &quot;12&lt;right arrow&gt;34&quot; to enter that.
i want the input field to automatically jump to the minutes field
after i entered the hours.

  review
</p>

<p>
phew, that&apos;s all the hacks i made.
now the phone became quite usable for me.
i have a few more generic thoughts.
note that i only care about the dumbphone qualities.
fancy stuff like camera, music, browsing, apps interest me not.
if someone is into that then they are probably better off with proper androids.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  battery
</p>

<p>
the battery level is shown via an icon in the status bar.
i wanted to make it show percentages but i think it&apos;s a nontrivial change.
each tenth level has a separate icon.
the icons themselves are in a ttf file.
they are unicode glyphs from unicode&apos;s private range.
it&apos;s not impossible to make this work, i just didn&apos;t care enough about it.
i can live with icons too.
</p>

<p>
you can check the exact battery percentage in the settings though,
see settings -&gt; device -&gt; battery.
you don&apos;t even need to get into the battery menu,
it will display the percentage while you are in the device menu already.
once in the settings, pressing left, left, up will get you to a place
where you can see the battery after a second or two.
</p>

<p>
i was quite worried about the battery life.
the most promising customer review said it lasts 4 days.
that would be annoying but i still gave this phone a shot.
i don&apos;t need any internet on my dumbphone
so i disabled wifi and cellular data on it.
i disabled gps too.
i even switched the phone to strictly 3g mode
since according to nokia&apos;s own documentation
the battery lasts for 28 days in 3g mode, but only 20 days in 4g mode.
</p>

<p>
to my surprise the battery life is quite reasonable!
at the time of writing i&apos;m on day 20 without charging and i still have 6% left.
and i used the alarm multiple times a day each day (with vibration),
some calls here and there,
accidentally kept the flashlight on for a few hours now and then.
otherwise on my light usage days it uses up about 4% battery.
i&apos;m quite satisfied with it.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  physical properties
</p>

<p>
the phone&apos;s body is made of very slippery plastic.
it slips very easily on a table.
i&apos;m not sure this is good or not, it doesn&apos;t really bother me.
</p>

<p>
you can open and close the phone with one hand
but requires some practice until you get the hang of it.
i feel it&apos;s harder than it should be.
it&apos;s quite odd to me that this got a design award
since it feels it could be much better:
e.g. some hole on the side with which you could open it easier.
</p>

<p>
the flip works fine but i feel it won&apos;t last 6 years.
i feel i&apos;ll have to replace this phone sooner than my previous 2g dumbphone.
not that i see anything wrong with the design,
just a general experience that whatever that moves will break down with time.
each time i want to set/disable an alarm (multiple times a day)
i have to open and close the phone.
i&apos;m sure that will wear the hinge down.
</p>

<p>
the vibrator on it is quite reasonable too.
the vibrator on the pixel4 was very weak.
i barely noticed it when it was on a desk
while i was in an otherwise quiet room.
no such problem with the nokia 2720.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  software
</p>

<p>
the call quality is pretty good, even in 3g mode.
the phone can be set to be adequately loud too.
my old nokia 105 was very quiet, so this is a big upgrade for me.
it can do loudspeaker and you can attach headphones too.
i tried it with a non-mic&apos;d headphone
but then i had to continue speaking into the phone.
the phone has to be open because it drops the call when you close it.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t like the phone&apos;s font setting.
it&apos;s either huge or enormous.
it can barely fit a single message on the screen.
this is probably also hackable, but i didn&apos;t bother.
my goal is to use the phone very little
so i can live with this inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
the keyboard seems fine so far, i can type easily.
it&apos;s pretty much what you would expect from a phone like this.
i can&apos;t really talk about the quality of its t9,
i don&apos;t write enough to be able to tell.
i haven&apos;t really used t9 before anyways.
i can easily switch t9&apos;s language on the fly
by holding down the # key so i might start finally writing via t9.
</p>

<p>
when closed and you press any of the side buttons once,
the external screens turns on and shows the clock for you.
every time you do this,
it shows the previous time for a very small fraction of a second
before it updates to the actual time.
i suspect it doesn&apos;t bother rerendering the screen
while the phone is sleeping which is good.
but it also demonstrates just how slow webtech is for simple things
like showing the clock.
this &quot;update time after turning on the screen&quot; is also present
when you open the phone.
even there you&apos;ll see the previous time for a small fraction of a second.
the effect is more visible in this mode
since it uses an animation to update the clock&apos;s digits.
it doesn&apos;t really bother me though.
</p>

<p>
the messaging app is threaded.
so the messages from a specific person are in a single screen
rather than spread across multiple messages like in my old phone.
that&apos;s fine although sometimes my message doesn&apos;t show up in the thread
after i&apos;ve sent it.
i have to quit the app and reopen it to make it appear.
</p>

<p>
the volume buttons on the side have a quirk too.
they set the volume of the current app.
if you happen to close the flip when an app is open (e.g. messaging or alarm),
then the volume keys will adjust the &quot;media volume&quot;.
if you want it to adjust the ringtone volume,
you have to exit all apps, go back to the main screen,
and only then close the phone.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  alarm clock
</p>

<p>
the alarm clock has some quirks due to the phone being suspended all the time.
it doesn&apos;t trigger exactly at the desired time,
it can delay almost up to a minute.
and because it starts later,
it sometimes doesn&apos;t even sound for a full minute, but stops early.
if you have a very slowly rising alarm then this might be a problem.
</p>

<p>
once i managed to completely miss an alarm.
i&apos;ve set the alarm to 05:00 and went to bed.
in the morning i slowly became awake
and started wondering what&apos;s the time.
i&apos;ve pressed the assistant button (that turns on the external screen)
and it showed 05:13 and lo and behold the alarm started sounding.
so this means i wasn&apos;t notified about the 05:00 alarm at all.
or if it did notify, it was too short for me to wake up.
i don&apos;t really mind becoming an alarm a minute or two later.
but 10+ minutes is too much.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m not the only one describing this problem,
just look at these posts and their comments:
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
fortunately the second thread explains the solution.
don&apos;t quit the alarm app, just minimize it.
press back to minimize the app,
don&apos;t press the end call button to leave.
or don&apos;t even bother quitting the app, just close the flip while it&apos;s running.
i&apos;ve started doing that and from that point i had no issues.
it doesn&apos;t seem to affect the battery life.
</p>

<p>
had i not seen this solution, i probably would have written my own clock app
that never stops playing the sound until i stop it.
but with the above hack i don&apos;t need to bother.
</p>

<p>
now i can&apos;t stop wondering
what interface would i make for a poweruser alarm clock app.
allow me to indulge on this fantasy while on topic.
all i need is a multiline textbox
where the line format would be &quot;hhmm[flags] arbitrary_comment&quot;.
it would be trivial to maintain even multiple alarms in it
and would be trivial for the app to figure out the next alarm.
i could simple write
</p>

<pre>
  0500n wake up!
  0930 go for a walk!
</pre>

<p>
to set up two alarms.
the n flag would mean no vibration.
i could have an x flag to mean a disabled alarm.
so after waking up and stopping the alarm,
the app would put an x after the wakeup entry:
</p>

<pre>
  0500nx wake up!
  0930 go for a walk!
</pre>

<p>
this auto-x could be prevented with, say,
an r flag which would mean a repeating alarm.
the ui would always show the next alarm
so i can have the confidence that i&apos;ve set up the alarms correctly.
easy peasy and very straightforward to implement.
i don&apos;t understand why people bother with complicated uis
that need megabytes of code to implement the simplest of things.
</p>

<p>
anyways.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  summary
</p>

<p>
apart from the big size, i think i&apos;m generally happy with the phone so far.
probably won&apos;t last forever
but hopefully by that time there will be other small 3g phones to choose from.

<h2 id="parttime">parttime</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>thinking about going part time.</p>
<p>
i haven&apos;t written for a while now
even though i have plenty of topics queued up.
i spend most of my free time secretly working on a small tool
that would make some operations at work a bit easier.
i think the industry term for this is &quot;20% time project&quot;.
i&apos;m doing this in my personal time (&quot;120% time project&quot;)
because it&apos;s not that much related to my core work
(it might end up nobody using it other than me)
and i&apos;m doing it just for the sake of achieving something useful
for my own entertainment.
it&apos;s not a big thing but has many edge cases
and i need to integrate with quite a few internal services.
i spend about 1h or less per day in the morning so it takes ages.
after 18:00 and during the weekends family takes all my time
so i don&apos;t really have time (or energy even) to work on it then.
(it&apos;s quite interesting to see now that i have less leisure time,
i&apos;m more conscious about using it well and pretty much achieve more.
it probably also means i do need the time pressure to achieve things.
but that&apos;s a topic to explore sometime later.)
</p>

<p>
after spending time on that, i don&apos;t really have time for anything else.
so then i have these fantasies about retiring and having all the free time.
but then i realize i pretty much like my workplace,
otherwise i wouldn&apos;t have the opportunity to work on tools like the one above.
i just want to have more freedom next to work.
so i&apos;m considering going 80% and having one weekday just for myself.
4 day weeks is the hotness lately anyways.
</p>

<p>
then i would have time to catch on my personal todo and bucket list,
read some books, watch tv, play games,
maybe spend more time away from the computer
without having too much guilt because i&apos;m not spending my time on work.
i could have a little taste of the retired life i so much yearn for
without the drastic change that a full retirement would require.
(i really don&apos;t want to sacrifice my evenings and weekends for this
so that i can remain present for my family.)
</p>

<p>
it also means i could save significantly less money
but in exchange i can have more leisure time now.
i think that&apos;s a fair trade.
world is changing all the time,
i suspect there&apos;s not much point to having large savings or net worth anyways.
having a large stash just makes you worry
whenever there&apos;s turbulence in the financial world.
you could see that worry big time in the fire community
(financial independence, retire early) when the covid pandemic started.
and what will all that money mean on my death bed anyways?
</p>

<p>
but there are some risks with this.
for me i think the biggest is this:
what will stop me from still checking emails all the time
and slowly drifting back to 100% while still retaining only 80% of the paycheck?
i guess i just need to be good at compartmentalizing
(i.e. avoiding my work laptop entirely on my off days)
and learn to not care about work even when things are going bad
(although i&apos;d probably still allow an occasional crunch).
but i&apos;ve read around and a lot of people went part time
and i haven&apos;t found a single account where someone regretted their decision.
</p>

<p>
also, i don&apos;t really take much vacation in general
so i could pretty much burn a vacation day per week for quite a few months
to try this.
i&apos;m actually doing this right now:
i took a day off even though my todo list at work is overflowing big time.
my only concern with that is
that the expectations don&apos;t really change accordingly.
but maybe i should learn to really just stop caring about the expectations.
it&apos;s hard because i don&apos;t like to break existing promises i made.
</p>

<p>
anyways, there&apos;s not much to this, either i do it or not.
the reason i&apos;m making this post publicly is
to plant the idea into my mind in a stronger manner
so that i&apos;m more likely to make the plunge.

<p style=font-weight:bold>send emails in the mornings!</p>
<p>
rube goldberg machines are machines
that solve very simple problems in an overcomplicated manner.
it&apos;s quite satisfying to start them:
once you start them, you can just sit back and relax.
the task is now outside of your control.
it might break, it might succeed, but for now you just need to wait and see.
</p>

<p>
whenever i send a document or commit for review,
or i just send an email with questions to someone,
i get a similar feeling.
while i didn&apos;t fully accomplish my task yet,
the task itself is now outside of my control
so i don&apos;t need to worry about it for a little while.
it&apos;s all on other people.
it&apos;s a very stoic approach to task management.
</p>

<p>
the problem at work is that there&apos;s always a lot more tasks to do.
so it&apos;s very hard to get to the &quot;sit back and relax&quot; state.
so here&apos;s an idea: don&apos;t send out your artifacts immediately!
</p>

<p>
keep working at stuff:
prepare docs, commits, email drafts, but hold on to them.
only send them out in the morning
right after you are done with your morning routine
or are interrupted otherwise.
this will accomplish four things:
</p>

<ul><li>
  in the morning you have an easy task to do: send out stuff.
  this means you start out the day productive
  and that feeling motivates you to do more thorough the day.
</li><li>
  if you managed to accumulate multiple artifacts the previous day(s)
  that you can now send out together,
  then you are now pretty much progressing on multiple tasks simultaneously
  without you making any sweat.
  and there&apos;s less guilt about not progressing at all whenever you make a break.
</li><li>
  you protect yourself from the expensive context switches.
  sometimes a response comes in that you could handle in a few minutes.
  but this breaks your flow and in reality costs you a lot more.
  if you can&apos;t respond today anyways,
  you won&apos;t feel a pressure to drop everything to respond right now.
</li><li>
  sometimes other people make you angry and you write an angry response.
  by the next morning you have calmed down
  and you won&apos;t send the angry response at all.
  this way you prevented making some of your relationships worse.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
of course there&apos;s lot of nuance to how to do this
without being annoying to others.
in general you would only do this with your tasks
and you wouldn&apos;t unreasonably slow down the progression of other people&apos;s tasks.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t really follow such a practice myself yet, only sometimes:
e.g. when i suddenly get inspired on a weekend and feel like working.
i might solve a few tasks but i don&apos;t send them out for review on the weekend.
i send them out the next monday.
i always felt good on such mondays and that&apos;s what i&apos;m trying to generalize.
i guess i&apos;ll experiment a bit and see.
</p>

<h2 id="cooldown">cooldown</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>forcing a wait before letting users exchange messages.</p>
<p>
how do you keep a discourse civil?
</p>

<p>
one approach is moderation or peer review
where another person looks at your message before sending.
they could flag any uncivil behavior that you would need to fix before publishing.
i think this can be pretty good but doesn&apos;t really work for private, one on one conversations
where there is no third party at all.
and the third party is not always predictably responsive.
e.g. what if the moderator or reviewer is on a vacation?
</p>

<p>
here&apos;s another idea: cooldown.
you can split sending a message into three steps:
draft the message, wait for a while (configurable but e.g. 1h), publish the draft.
</p>

<p>
there would be no auto-publish: the publish would be a conscious action.
and an edit would reset the cooldown
so you need to make the weird decision
whether to publish an imperfect message or wait even longer.
</p>

<p>
so the idea is that you don&apos;t send your initial draft,
you yourself review your own message, hopefully in a different, cooler mood
in which you won&apos;t send a rude message.
if the message isn&apos;t worth waiting 1h for,
then it&apos;s maybe better if you don&apos;t send it at all.
</p>

<p>
you can adhere to such rules yourself
but maybe a discussion forum plagued with flamewars could enact this on its members indiscriminately.
it could cool its members down a bit without fully stopping the discussion.
it would definitely drive some people away but that&apos;s good:
large discussion forums are hard to maintain
and bringing down its population count is probably good.
hopefully the people who remain are the ones
who are really motivated to publish their thoughts, not just gut reactions.
and as the community cools, the admins can lower the cooldown duration.
</p>

<p>
i do expect that some members would use browser extensions to auto-publish messages
and defeat the whole purpose of this restriction.
but there&apos;s still the possibility of a user reconsidering a message even if it&apos;s auto-published.
so there is some potential benefit even in this case.
and i&apos;d also expect that only a minority of people would bother installing such extensions
so the overall effect would be still strong.
</p>

<p>
this relates a bit to my previous #/batch post
where i recommended waiting until morning to send messages.
that is pretty much infeasible for most things
but with the cooldown idea one can get to it halfway.
prepare all the drafts one by one
and then pretty much send them at once even during the day.
</p>

<p>
not sure if this is a good idea
but if i ever were to build a discussion forum
(or even something like an anonymous comment section on a blog like this),
i&apos;d definitely try this 3 step method
as an attempt to increase the quality of the messages.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d implement an anonymous comment section like this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  you have an edit box where the user can prepare their message.
</li><li>
  once they complete their draft, they hit the &quot;save draft&quot; button.
</li><li>
  this sends their comment&apos;s hash to the server.
</li><li>
  the server appends a timestamp to that hash and hashes that using a secret salt.
</li><li>
  the server sends back the timestamp and the new hash to the user&apos;s browser.
</li><li>
  the comment form will tell the user to come back in 5 minutes
  and if they still want to publish, they can do so then.
</li><li>
  after 5 minutes they click publish
  and the form sends the previous timestamp and new hash along the contents.
</li><li>
  the server verifies the hash using the secret salt
  and if it checks out, the comment appears.
</li><li>
  for extra protection: increase the cooldown duration with each new message by one minute.
  e.g. after 10 messages the users would need to wait 15 minutes to publish a message.
  this would prevent the comment section from suddenly blowing up
  and encourage moving long discussions to some other place.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
sounds complicated but i think it should be pretty easy to implement
without keeping any extra state on the server.
it doesn&apos;t really protect against a dedicated spammer
but might work fine in the wild until the blog becomes a target.
</p>

<h2 id="freewrite">freewrite</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>freewriting is the best adult pacifier.</p>
<p>
adults use pacifiers to calm down babies.
but adults have their own pacifiers too, e.g.:
</p>

<ul><li>
  checking email, facebook, memes;
</li><li>
  snacking on some food or drink (e.g. coffee);
</li><li>
  smoking;
</li><li>
  playing games;
</li><li>
  watching youtube or porn.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
when one is waiting for something, e.g.
</p>

<ul><li>
  a webpage to load;
</li><li>
  waiting for a response in a messaging app;
</li><li>
  compilation to finish (https://xkcd.com/303/);
</li><li>
  waiting to be motivated to start something, aka procrastinating,
</li>
</ul>

<p>
one is tempted to switch to such a pacifying activity.
i guess that&apos;s because most people are very uncomfortable with just waiting.
</p>

<p>
there are two problems with the above pacifiers:
</p>

<ul><li>
  they are addictive and hard to stop so you might spend more time on them
  than on the activity you wanted to do in the first place.
</li><li>
  you lose a lot of momentum with the task due to the context switch.
  e.g. during a coding session&apos;s compilation phase you notice some important email
  and you start writing a response to that.
  you just pretty much throw out 10+ minutes worth of context out of your head.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so what to do instead?
freewrite!
get a notebook and every time you need to wait
and/or have an urge to do something else,
just write out the uncomfortableness instead!
</p>

<p>
this shouldn&apos;t be your notebook for todo lists.
this should be a write only notebook that you just append thoughts to,
which are never to be read again.
</p>

<p>
if you don&apos;t know know what to write,
just write down what is actually happening.
e.g. &quot;i&apos;m waiting for a response from john.
i feel like i should check on my email.
i&apos;m expecting an important email, i wonder i got it already.
probably not.
what should i respond to john if he doesn&apos;t like my idea? [...]&quot;
</p>

<p>
keep your device open at the activity that you are waiting for.
while writing you&apos;ll quickly notice if your webpage finished loading or you received your response
so you can immediately switch back to your previous activity.
with writing you don&apos;t need to wait until you &quot;finish&quot; your pacifier activity.
writing can fill any duration you need to wait and can be easily stopped anytime.
</p>

<p>
it is very weird at the beginning but quite nice once the habit is established.
you&apos;ll lose less context by this
and at the same time it helps you to organize your thoughts in general.
it&apos;s a win-win!
</p>

<h2 id="intmon">intmon</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>no to intellectual monopoly!</p>
<p>
by intellectual monopoly (intmon) i mean a government mandated monopoly for specific ideas or creations.
i mean mostly copyright and patents.
trademarks are fine since they are for protecting specific identities
so that the consumers can trust the actual product.
</p>

<p>
abolishing them has lot of upsides: more content and products, lower prices, etc.
you can easily mix and match content and share it with everyone without repercussions.
you can freely invent new things and not worry about patent trolls pestering you.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand intmon seems one of those things
that people simply cannot imagine life without.
but i&apos;m quite convinced that if it wouldn&apos;t exist and you wanted to introduce it,
it would be met with huge resistance.
in an intmon-free world completely different business models would have emerged.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  copyright
</p>

<p>
in the copyright case i&apos;d expect people wouldn&apos;t be selling the actual content
but rather their self and their brand.
this is already happening with youtube creators.
they are not selling their videos, those are free.
if they have a large number of subscribers (high influence)
they sell that to sponsors by mentioning their products in their video.
and most of them do this in a sensible manner:
they review the product themselves
which actually makes me want to watch through their sponsored section.
it&apos;s not the insensitive random annoying ads that the internet is full of.
</p>

<p>
lot of book authors these days have a blog with large following.
they could publish their writing there first
and once they have enough content,
they could bind it into a big book.
or if they have a popular book already,
they could be touring and talking about it with people
like how musicians tour and give concerts.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d expect more demand for customized content:
what if a vocal group really likes a fanfic of a popular tv show?
now small scale studios can create that on demand.
and if people can get their wishes created rather than choosing from a selection,
i&apos;d expect people would be happier with the content,
and pay even more, further exacerbating the demand.
perhaps content would be paid beforehand rather than after like it&apos;s done currently.
</p>

<p>
and in case of copyright i acknowledge that there would be less aaa games and movies
because big studios couldn&apos;t justify spending millions in creating something
that will be free in the end.
but i think that&apos;s fine.
those millions of moneys and human hours saved can go to more useful things
like research, infrastructure maintenance or humanitarian causes.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  patents
</p>

<p>
on the patent side the most common counterargument is about the research.
who will do the research if not big companies who do it in exchange for patents?
drug companies are the most common example
where a drug needs lots of millions of dollars to develop
but very easy to produce once the r&amp;d is done
so the r&amp;d company needs some protection to recoup costs.
</p>

<p>
but this assumes that it&apos;s companies who need to do this complex research.
academia has not even a chance because these companies poach all the researchers from it.
i&apos;d expect that without patents maybe drug companies wouldn&apos;t invest that much into research
but rather they would fund academia where researchers could now stay and earn good pay.
and because academia is open and independent,
a global community could work on the more important things
rather than drug companies developing yet another antidepressant drug.
but it&apos;s hard to tell what would happen
but i&apos;m quite convinced that research would still happen,
researchers wouldn&apos;t disappear into thin air.
</p>

<p>
another argument is that lack of patents encourage secrecy and complexity to maintain the secrecy.
but what companies can keep a secret today, they already keep that as a secret.
patents are used mostly for easily reverse-engineered or replicated products.
sure, it&apos;s a risk that the r&amp;d develops something easily replicable.
if a company doesn&apos;t like that risk, maybe it shouldn&apos;t do such r&amp;d in the first place.
i don&apos;t find it a compelling reason that private r&amp;d should be rewarded like that.
i&apos;d rather see more open research done in the academia instead
and ensure that any r&amp;d fruits can be immediately enjoyed by everyone at the lowest cost.
</p>

  other thoughts
</p>

<p>
for reference i&apos;ve run this idea through r/changemyview:
https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ofdnn1/cmv_a_copyrightpatentipfree_world_is_nicer/.
it didn&apos;t really make any change in my views.
most commenters assumed that we would continue to use the current business models in the intmon-free world
and then explain how that wouldn&apos;t work (&quot;people would just steal your work and sell it cheaper&quot;).
well duh.
that&apos;s not what i&apos;m arguing here.
i couldn&apos;t really get into the details
because discussions on r/changemyview are incredibly exhausting.
i&apos;d probably need to divide my views into subpoints:
lack of aaa content, no drug patents, secrecy, etc.
but i&apos;d expect discussing even the subpoints would be exhausting.
i&apos;ll expand my thoughts about r/changemyview in general in an upcoming post.
</p>

<p>
in practice, while i respect the right of others,
i assume any of my output is public domain.
i don&apos;t really care how people use it.
but i&apos;m not producing any meaningful content really so it doesn&apos;t really matter anyways.
</p>

<h2 id="cmv">cmv</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>r/changemyview is a pretty safe corner in the harsh internet.</p>
<p>
https://reddit.com/r/changemyview is a heavily moderated forum with strict rules
that try to maintain civility in very sensitive topics.
usually such topics go crazy very quickly on a typical internet forum
but this doesn&apos;t seem to plague this forum.
</p>

<p>
the idea is that someone posts some view they harbor
and the commenters will try to convince the author of the opposite,
or at least have the author learn more nuance about the issues.
funny comments, agreeing with the author, rudeness gets all removed
so the thread stays very much focused on the author&apos;s view.
</p>

<p>
and the whole thing is gamified.
whenever the author acknowledges that they have shifted their view
or gained a more nuanced view about their issue thanks to a comment,
they have to give that comment a &quot;delta&quot;.
basically they have to include &quot;!delta&quot; or &quot;Δ&quot; in their response.
a bot then counts the delta points over the whole subreddit
and displays the accumulated delta points next to each username.
it&apos;s probably a nice feeling to get rewarded with such a point
and that might keep people engaged in the discussions.
</p>

<p>
the delta system also helps researchers to understand
what makes some comments more persuasive than others.
here&apos;s one academic&apos;s research site about this.
note specifically the media coverage section:
https://chenhaot.com/pages/changemyview.html.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve tried posting some of my crazy views to see what happens:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /uppercase: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/oaqzcz/cmv_writing_doesnt_inherently_need_uppercase
</li><li>
  /binding: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o0z5jj/cmv_books_should_be_wirebound/
</li><li>
  /intmon: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ofdnn1/cmv_a_copyrightpatentipfree_world_is_nicer/
</li>
</ul>

<p>
although the discourse remains relatively civil,
the whole thing is quite overwhelming.
for one, there&apos;s a lot of repetition
since most commenters don&apos;t seem to read the other comment threads.
and some commenters seem still quite mean even if they are within all the rules
which can make responding to the commenters quite exhausting emotionally.
</p>

<p>
and then i quickly learn that most issues can be broken down into smaller issues
that need to be discussed separately.
discussing everything in one big thread can get confusing.
e.g. when i wanted to argue about the usage of uppercase letters,
i could break that down into capitalization of sentence beginnings
and the capitalization of names.
those must be argued completely differently.
</p>

<p>
and it&apos;s incredibly time consuming.
understanding your opponents&apos; arguments,
preparing a detailed but short response is not trivial.
i think such discussions can&apos;t happen on a very short timeframe.
while i gained a bit of nuance during the discussions,
they didn&apos;t fundamentally change my views.
i feel i&apos;d need to invest more time into the whole thing for that to happen,
not just the few hours i reserved to test the site.
</p>

<p>
and i felt quite disconnected from my opponents:
i didn&apos;t feel i understand them, and i didn&apos;t feel they understand me either.
i think anonymous forums are not for me.
i prefer to know my opponent personally, i think that can make the communication more effective.
i think i&apos;d prefer to be paired with a single person to discuss an issue over months
and maybe then present a shared document that contains our agreement
rather than arguing with a dozen people at the same time.
reddit doesn&apos;t really have a good way to present long back&amp;forth discussions anyways.
</p>

<p>
while i probably won&apos;t be posting much to r/changemyview,
it&apos;s definitely a site where i can look up discussions about almost any topic.
all i need to do is to append &quot;site:reddit.com/r/changemyview&quot; into my search query.
i recommend anyone fancying online discussions to explore this site too.
