#deadend

it seems you have reached a dead end in my dialog tree.
unless otherwise noted above this means
that i thought people won't reach this point
or i was not sure how to branch from this node.
if you managed to reach this node
with honest answers and you are willing to open a discussion
then send me an email to qxp2fs8j at anonaddy.me.
expand your thoughts about this node.
maybe with new information i can update the dialog tree
to clarify or update my nodes to cover more nuance.

#intro

let's try having a virtual dialog!
i'll ask you questions and you can select an answer from my options.
i know this is a very limited way of having a "discussion"
but it's just another silly experiment from me.
it's a dialog tree where each node is a question
and the answer options are branches to other questions.

would you be interested in playing this?

@select1 yes
@introquit no

#introquit

if you aren't interested then we shall part our ways here.

#select1

awesome!
but don't expect much.
i only prepared a couple nodes in this dialog tree so it's quite short.

maybe you feel some unease
having the reply options limited only to a few options.
they might not include your true answer.
you can always email me with a new option and i might include that too.
but otherwise you should always select the option
that feels closest to your heart or is otherwise the least wrong.
if i did this right, some questions might take a minute or two of introspection
to figure out the least wrong answer.

let's start with a simple thing.
i ask you to choose option 1 below.
you can now choose option 1 and we can go to more interesting topics.
or you can choose option 2 and i'll try to convince you to choose option 1
via further dialog nodes.

@select1pass option 1
@select1why2 option 2

#select1why2

hmm. interesting.
you chose 2.
may i ask why?

@select1defy just to defy instructions
@select1defy curious how could you convince me
@select1mistake selected 2 by mistake

#select1defy

so you chose this option to defy me or just out of curiosity.
yes i'm using the same node for both of those responses.
it's just a reminder
that this dialog tree doesn't have high production value.

i still want you to select option 1.
otherwise i'll have pretty hard time trying to talk with you.
it's a small non-important act that shouldn't really matter,
especially in this silly web dialog context.
if you find doing that hard, then i predict that you would have hard time
working with many other hypothetical situations of mine out of stubbornness.
meaningful conversations for me need lots of make believe, imagination,
and willingness to play around with the other person's strawmans.

so i'll ask you to go back and try that node again
and now select 1.
on the other hand i don't want to gate the dialog on this point
so you can skip this node
but i expect that you'll be disagreeing with me a lot.
or you already see that this game goes nowhere
and you would rather quit right here and now.

@select1 try again
@select1pass skip
@select1quit quit

#select1mistake

if it was a mistake then you should be able
to use your browser's back button and select your intended option.
do it 2 times and you should able to go down the right path.

i don't mean this game to be exploratory,
but i won't put hurdles in front of you in case you are into that.

#select1quit

i find such early quit a bit sad but it's the best for both us.
otherwise we would be just wasting each other's time.

#select1pass

we are past the first hurdle and you are still here.
great!

keep in mind i don't track anything you do here,
i'm not that interested in such data anyways.
and don't take this whole thing too seriously,
i too have a lot to learn.

i recommend starting a draft email to log the answers and to note comments
and in the end you can send that to me
so that i can see how did you get through this.

i'm not even sure how to start this conversation.
i guess let's start with this: what brings you here?
how did you learn about this game?

@rss i'm subscribed to your rss feed
@stumbled i stumbled on your site and noticed this page
@sharedlink i've seen this linked somewhere

#rss

rss?
people still use that thing?
well, i'm glad i didn't set that up in vain.

my rss feed is pretty minimal though.
it just links to the content on my page.
is this a fine behavior for a feed in your opinion?

@here yes, it's fine
@badrss no, it's bothersome

#badrss

well, i presume it's not ideal.
i could easily make the feed contain the full text of my posts.
but nobody complained about it before so i didn't bother.
its implementation is much simpler that it only contains titles and urls.

and besides, a small feed is much healthier for the internet in general.
whole /rss page fits into a single tcp packet.
it's very light on the feed readers.
so think of this like i'm doing this for a greener internet!

@here i can live with it
@badrss2 it's still wrong

#badrss2

wrong it might be, but simple.
i personally don't use rss myself.
back when google reader was a thing,
i was addicted to reading all my feeds.
i wasted a lot of time on just keeping up to date with them.

then one day i decided that it's enough.
from now on no more rss feeds for me.
and i didn't simply move the blogs of interests into bookmarks.
i just decided to regularly check them whenever i remember doing so.
if i forget something then that's good: more free time for myself!

so in general i'm not that fond of this rss technology.
however i do acknowledge that some people rely on it.
so decided to meet in the middle:
minimal rss so that people can see the notifications of new posts at least,
but otherwise i wouldn't spend much effort on it.

i might be doing it wrong but as long as it can notify people of new posts,
i don't particularly mind the wrongness.
i might be convinced otherwise though.
just send me an email about this but let's continue otherwise.

@here ok
@here i'll send you an email and you shall continue

#stumbled

maybe you were looking at my github page and noticed the link there?
then you clicked around?
wow, that's dedication, i admire your interest in my stuff!

i wonder though, what's your primary interest here?

@here the personal posts
@here the demo posts

#sharedlink

people share links to my site?
was it from me? if not then i'm flabbergasted.
i don't think this node will be ever honestly activated.
this site is quite unfriendly
and i totally not care about popularity or attracting readers.
i just write my private thoughts here and make it public.
but i still must prepare a node for this option so here i am.
i won't even bother writing answer options here.

@here ok, please continue

#here

awesome!
in any case, what's important is that you are here now.

btw, remember, i don't always provide good response options.
in such cases just pick whatever that feels closest to your actual answer
or is the least wrong otherwise.

in the meantime i realized how is one supposed to start a conversation.
i ask this question: how are you?

@allgood thanks, i feel pretty good in general
@sad well, i feel a bit low these days

#allgood

that's great to hear!
may i ask what might be your most significant source of joy?

remember: if unsure, then pick the least wrong.

@strongcommunity i have a strong community of support (family, friends, peers)
@keepingbusy work, games, achievements or drugs keep me happily busy

#strongcommunity

so we can say that a big chunk of your happiness comes from others
one way or another.
i think deep down that's where almost everyone gets their happiness
even if in a very indirect manner.

given we are all good here, let me change the topic a bit.
i'm more interested in the other side:
what makes people unhappy?
do you have days where you feel sad or really unmotivated?

@sad yeah, i do have my sad days sometimes
@stoic nope, i'm very strong, nothing can bring me down

#keepingbusy

that's interesting.
i wonder: is it the activities or achievements themselves that make you happy
or is it rather other people's recognition (or potential future recognition)
of those achievements that make you happy about them?

@happilybusy my activities/achievements make me happy
@recognition the recognition makes me happy

#recognition

yeah, positive recognition can feel quite good.
it means that people appreciate your existence.
it gives meaning to life:
even if you don't know the meaning of your own life,
maybe there's some meaning in other people's life.
with helping them you just made their life a bit easier,
and thus you contributed to whatever goals life has in an indirect way.
recognition is the way they let you know that this has happened.

i'm more interested in the other side though:
what makes people unhappy?
do you have days where you feel sad or really unmotivated?

@sad yeah, i do have my sad days
@stoic nope, i'm very strong, nothing can bring me down

#stoic

are you a stoic sage perhaps?
did you learn to be like this or you were always like this?

@consciousstoic i reached this stage consciously
@alwayshappy nope, i'm just naturally like this

#consciousstoic

oh, that's really intriguing!
mind dropping me an email about what conscious actions you took
and maybe a few examples of some struggles and how you overcame them?

#happilybusy

that's really interesting.
i'd have expected the recognition would be more important.
my problem with this is that in the end all these things don't really matter.
sure, it can be fun to work on interesting problems, or play fun games all day.
however after a while they start to feel empty for me.
the things lose meaning if it's only up to me.

suppose all other life disappears from the planet except from you.
the infrastructure keeps functional though.
so you can remain well fed and live in comfort for free until your death.
you can freely travel anywhere, read books, play any videogames, etc.
and when you die, all life on earth is gone.

how would you react over a long term?

@remainhappy i'd probably get used to this and remain happy
@getdepressed things would lose meaning and i would end up depressed

#remainhappy

this response is certainly in line with your previous response.
i'm not sure i could stay sane for long.

first to lose would be my personal hygiene.
why should i shave at all?
why should i clean myself?
nobody will complain that i smell anyways.
it would be just a waste of time.

next up my sense of time.
maybe i would start a game and then i'd stay up late just to finish it.
i don't have any responsibilities so there's nothing to lose by doing this.
this repeats multiple times and i'm completely out of sync
from the normal solar day-night cycle.

next up my eating habits.
why bother cooking at all
when i can eat all the potato chips i want all day long?
why would i need any other nourishment?

all these combined lead to self destruction over time.
there would be nobody trying to talk some sense to me.
even if i were to complain, there would be noone that could listen.
so the outlook is not good for me.
but maybe i get bored of the games and recover from all this mess.
maybe i could build a daily habit to keep my sanity.
but the danger of self destroying myself before i do that is real.

would this not happen to you?

@strongcommunity well, on a second thought i might need others after all
@loner nope, i'd figure out how to stay sane and live happily

#getdepressed

yeah, same with me.
if there's nobody around to interact with
then i'd totally start question the point of life itself.
i might easily start going crazy
when there's nobody around me to bring me back to reality.

but this response is in tension with your previous response.
so you also need other people for your happiness.
maybe in the end it's still the recognition
that you are yearning for but in a rather indirect manner?

is this true?

@strongcommunity well, maybe, i get my happiness from others
@loner no, others are necessary but not sufficient for my happiness

#loner

so you generally do fine alone.
you don't need the recognition or validation from others in order to be happy.
i imagine this is a really rare trait.
but let me ask this:
suppose you achieve something spectacular.
e.g. reach a high score in a game or a physical exercise,
come up with an elegant algorithm,
or simply finish some project you worked on for a while.

does it bring you joy when people admire you for your achievement?
does it bring you joy when people give you a deep thanks for your help?

@spotlight sure
@unimportant nope, i totally don't care

#unimportant

oh wow.
that's quite an unexpected response!
so if you don't care about the people's impressions of your work,
then perhaps you don't even care publishing your achievement, right?
but if publishing is not important, why bother doing it in the first place?

i guess it's like writing a diary or a journal.
but not really: often a diary is also just a means to organize one's thoughts.
i'm running a bit dry here.

it's a bit unclear to me if people would ever honestly reach this node at all.
if you do then please let me know
and i'll definitely extend this branch of the tree.
but for now i'll end the discussion here.

#spotlight

so you do get some joy from others
but maybe it's not the biggest source of your happiness.
or maybe you just generally don't experience strong emotions,
and that's why you don't really miss interactions from others.

so let me ask you this:
do you still feel sad on some days?

@sad yes, i have sad days
@alwayshappy nope, pretty much all days are the same for me

#alwayshappy

oh, that's quite interesting.
so you are quite stable emotionally.
i wonder, how does your average day look like?
let me know directly
since i'm not sure how to branch here without more information,
i'll keep this node a dead end
until i had a chance to talk to someone reaching this.

#sad

so you have days where you feel quite sad or depressed.
i think there are many reasons people might get sad.
sometimes the cause is very clear (e.g. grief), but often it's not.
i'm generally quite interested in the causes of sadness.
however usually it's not easy for people to talk about their depression.
and i'm super bad in human communication
so this interest is not well matched with my actual skills.

i wager one common source of depression these days is "loneliness".
there's no one in your life that gives some meaning to it.
there's no one for whom you feel compelled to wake up
and get yourself together every day.
or maybe you have someone in your life who is supposed to be that,
but you no longer feel a strong connection to that person.
do you feel you are sad because of that?

remember: if unsure, then just pick whichever is closer to your truth.

@lonely yeah, maybe something like that
@notlonely no, it's something else in my case

#notlonely

yeah, there are myriads of other reasons that one might get depressed.
maybe it's because of a loss of a loved one.
or maybe because one really bad experience of something in the past.
or maybe even something wrong with your body's emotion management.
all of these are super hard problems.
and i certainly don't want to trigger those emotions unnecessarily
so let me stop here rather than digging further.
i'm happy to listen and/or challenge your thoughts in case you drop me an email.

#lonely

i wonder, are you in a relationship
or do you have someone in your life with whom you feel absolute trust
and that you can unconditionally depend on to support you in various matters?
i think one can feel quite lonely even in a relationship.
or one could feel quite fulfilled without a traditional relationship:
maybe one could feel good among family or friends.

@missing i'm in a good relationship and i don't know what's missing
@issues my relationship has some issues
@single i'm not in a relationship

#single

i see.
but are you looking for a new relationship?

@newrelationship yes
@norelationship no

#norelationship

so you are lonely but you are not looking for a new relationship.
i feel a bit of a tension here.
i'm curious now.
mind dropping me an email and telling me about your situation?

#newrelationship

what sort of relationship are you looking for?

@monogamy an exclusive relationship (monogamous)
@polyamory a good, caring friend (polyamorous basically)

#missing

so you have a good relationship but it's not entirely fulfilling
and you are not sure what could make it better.
maybe you feel you just want "more" but not sure from what.
i think often this uncertainty can stem from "missing out".
i mean you have curiosity for other relationships, affairs,
or just experiences that your current relationship can't grant you.

@polyamory yeah, i'm indeed curious what's out there
@notcurious no, i'm not curious about anything, it's something else

#notcurious

if it's not curiosity then it might be some form of tension in relationship.
or maybe it's just being bored with the relationship
or you thought a relationship means more (you had higher expectations)?
so if i squint, i could say,
you do have an issue with your relationship after all?

@issues yeah, there's an issue
@noissues no, really, there are no issues

#issues

there are gazillion potential problems a relationship can have.
maybe it's communication issues.
or a personality mismatch.
or maybe someone doesn't give enough effort into it.
or maybe one of the partners is not so excited about the relationship.

most relationships start with quite a hot phase,
when people think that nothing can ever divide them.
but when the happy hormones subside,
the relationship's quality boils down
to the couple's compatibility with each other.

however to determine compatibility one needs to clearly articulate
the expectations and the acceptable costs for the relationship.
these discussions can be super hard
especially given that often one doesn't even know
what expectation they really have for the other person.
more often than not a 3rd party mediator (or a couple therapist)
can help a lot.

so i wonder did you already try to have
a deep and meaningful conversation about the issues?

@communication i've tried but it didn't really help
@communication i didn't try it yet or found it impossible to do so

#communication

communication is really hard.
even if you do communicate, it's unclear if the other person really hears you.
but i think it's important to make the other person hear you.
that's why i suggested a mediator previously
who might be able to translate your language to the other person's language.
maybe you talk too abstractly
but the other person needs a more down to earth language.

in general, i think communication is key to a happy life.
it gives some meaning to live.
if you can't communicate, you might as well be a piece of rock.
good communication also requires good introspection abilities.
some people might be just not that interested in such things,
they might be more interested in the more experienceful life
of traveling, partying and just having fun rather than contemplating.
maybe you are simply too far away on some scale from each other
(e.g. introvert-extrovert scale).

if it's not working out then maybe it's not worth investing all the energy
into such inefficient relationships.
ideally, one could start making small changes in their lives
and see how things change.
one example change could be
to drop the exclusivity requirement in their relationship.
however for lots of people it's all or nothing when it comes to relationships,
which then results in an incredibly high bar for happiness.

how do you feel about this?

@monogamy monogamy is important for me
@polyamory i don't have issues with respectful polyamory

#noissues

hmm, your relationship feels pretty good
and you aren't bored with it nor curious for more.
i have no idea right now what could be the problem.
mind telling me about your relationship and your opinion of it?

#monogamy

so monogamy is important to you.
let me test your resolution with a far fetched hypothetical.

suppose it's now time for you to finally settle down with a partner.
and your options boil down to two choices.
there is a partner who prefers monogamy
but that person is quite boring
and you know you'll be bored for most of the time.
but you won't have to worry about cheating in exchange.
the other option is a partner who you know is totally into you
and you can assume they will remain that way.
you will have ton of fun with them
and you know they will care about you well.
but they are polyamorous.
they will have a bit less time for you
and they will spend fun time with others without you,
maybe make others feel special just like you.
and you really have to choose now.

which path would you choose in this situation?

@strictlymonogamy constant boredom just to ensure monogamy
@polyamory endure polyamory in order to have the fun and feeling cared for

#strictlymonogamy

so monogamy is such an important virtue in your life
that you would forego a fun life just to maintain it?
for me it's a bit hard to imagine what could be so important about this.
mind dropping me an email about this so that i can pick your brain a bit?

#polyamory

in the traditional relationships people vow exclusivity to each other.
but then as time goes on and the initial chemical high subsides,
what usually remains is a deep, intimate, respectful friendship.
but the exclusivity restriction remains
and often causes lot of (often just an internal) tension.
people build these artificial barriers of expectations
and often the same barriers limit people and make them sad.
exclusivity is a simple rule.
the lack of it is very nuanced and requires lot of communication.
but if done right, it can lead to a quite fulfilling life.
there's no reason to have only one good friend.
different friends can fill different holes in one's heart after all.

i wonder, what is the hole you feel missing right now?
do you yearn for more intimacy and/or sex in your life?
or do you just need a good friend,
who you can care about, or can care about you,
with whom you can talk/play/lunch/travel a lot?

@intimacy intimacy or sexual hole
@friendship friendship hole

#friendship

interesting.
now i wonder about your sex life.
do you feel fulfilled sexually?

@enoughsex enough satisfying sex one way or another
@asexual i'm bit of an asexual

#enoughsex

can one be ever be fully satisfied?
i wonder, what are your sexual habits?
do you not have unfulfilled fantasies?
what is your peak fantasy?
mind telling me about it?

#asexual

interesting.
i think there's two ways to be asexual.
one way is when you don't mind doing things,
they just don't excite you.
the other way is when you feel deep disgust or other negative emotion
when it comes to sex.
which one describes you better?

@boringsex it's just not exciting
@badsex i have strong negative emotions about it

#badsex

if you have strong negative emotions about sex
then perhaps i shouldn't be digging to deep here.
but if you are happy to talk about this,
then please drop me an email.

#boringsex

i think i can empathize.
i did some tantramassage courses in the past.
and sometimes i was paired with a guy both on the giving and receiving side.
i think i did everything right but it just wasn't exciting.
but if the other person enjoys it, i think that's already good.

but i'm still curious:
there must be something that could excite you, no?
mind telling me about it and how come you are not seeking it?

#intimacy

yeah, i think most people have a desire
to share all their inner feelings and act out some of the impulses
in a safe and trusting environment.
one just needs to find the right partner
where one can be safe to share anything and be anything.

is it easy for you to open up to people about deepest thoughts?

@openingup yeah, i can easily open up
@notsharing not really, i like to keep things to myself

#openingup

do you also like to talk about sex and your fantasies?

@sextalk yeah, no, problem
@notsharing that aspect bit less so

#notsharing

sharing our deep secrets can be quite hard.
maybe we fear humiliation, discrimination, or other consequences.
i wonder what makes it hard for you to share your thoughts?

#sextalk

talking about sex can be very awkward at first but can become quite liberating
once people step past any shame that is around the topic.
sex is an intimate thing to do with another person,
it's a special connection.
i think it's good to be open about it.

for example my favorite giving activities at the time of writing are
massaging, licking, biting breasts and
giving cunnilingus (i could do this for hours).
on the receive side i like it best
when my ears are being nibbled and blown or panted into,
my neck being bitten, my back being scratched,
for sex itself i prefer being on the bottom
but find the missionary the easiest for good performance.
and i generally like slow rhythm than going at it fast.
i might like being restrained too,
i haven't really experimented with such things.
(i'd totally would like to experience
a naked tickle torture while fully restrained.)

tell me, what are your favorite things in sex?
