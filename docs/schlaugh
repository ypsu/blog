# schlaugh: it's a nice, update-once-daily social media site.

if i ever convince myself to join a social media, it most likely will be https://www.schlaugh.com.

the key feature of it is that it updates only once per day and each member can post at most one message per day.
you check it out once per day and you move on with your life.
there's no like buttons, no "algorithm", no doomscrolling, no shouting matches, etc.
basically social media without the addictive features.

it still has a concept of the feed though.
iiuc you can subscribe to a list of tags or users.
and then you can check out new posts of them once per day.

the site supports markdown and has special syntax for linking users and specific posts for cross-referencing.
but otherwise it has no "explore" functionality.
you learn about other users or interesting tags from other posts.

now keep in mind i have not yet actually tried the site, i just really like its rules.

i was fantasizing about "slow communication" sites before, see @/slowpals.
schlaugh is a bit different than i was describing but i think it could also fill the void i was talking about in that post.
fortunately i'm currently sated communication-wise.
i'm forcing myself to write at least one post per month both on here and on my work-internal blog too.
that pretty much satisfies my cravings for some communication.
but if i ever become jobless and my todo backlog is empty, i might join the site for some additional excitement.
i made this post about it so that i don't forget.
