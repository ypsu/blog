# pkgtrim: a linux package trimmer tool

this post is about my little https://ypsu.github.io/pkgtrim project.

i tend to install too much crap on my machine and never uninstall them.
this always bothered my minimalistic senses but i wasn't sure how to deal with this situation.

a friend showed me nixos and how you can have a config file and then drive the system installation from that config.
i didn't really like nixos, it felt a bit too complex for my simple needs.
but i really liked the config driven part.

the other thing he showed me was https://github.com/utdemir/nix-tree.
this is a package explorer for nixos.
it can also tell you the list and size of the "unique dependencies" for a package.
these are the packages that have no other reverse dependencies other than the given package.
i really liked that because those are all the packages i could get rid of after uninstalling the given package.

my system is archlinux and after that meeting i was wondering how to have an intent driven installation and allow me to explore package relationships in a simple manner.
i think i've managed to figure it out.
this is what i came up with: https://ypsu.github.io/pkgtrim/.

the ~/.pkgtrim on my small rpi4 contains all packages i need along with a comment why i need them.
while setting it up i've managed to delete some garbage from my system.
now i could easily reinstall the whole machine, run `pkgtrim -install`, and end up with the same packages installed as i have now.
and i can keep the .pkgtrim file in my dotfiles repo.
i think i will sleep better now.

oh and i used my new @/difftesting approach to develop this.
writing this tool was a breeze!
