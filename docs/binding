# binding: keeping books open is hard.

i really like reading books. i do not do it often though. it mostly happens in
batches where i read many books over a few days when i have a few days of
calmness available around me. these days i usually read on kindle. it is very
convenient, light and there is the benefit that i do not need to physically
store the books. i do not like the idea of having a bookcase of the all the
books i ever read: it takes space, maintenance (ugh, i hate cleaning) and i do
not really want others see what i read. having said all that i do occassionally
run across a physical book. usually someone loans one to me, or i just pick one
up randomly when i am at a place which has books and i have time. my problem is
that the book usability is quite bad due to the way the pages are bound
together!

for instance i cannot just open the typical book in the middle and put it onto
the desk and read it from there. it would just close itself like a spring. i
have to keep holding the pages to keep the book from closing. if i want to hold
the book in air, i often need two hands. for one hand holding, i have to roll
over one side of the book. reading the rolled side is quite annoying if even
possible. it is also very easy to break the binding. once i do that, the book
becomes more brittle, the individual papers might fall out much easier. also i
have to hold the book slightly differently depending i am reading the beginning,
the middle or the end of it.

what annoys me the most is that all those problems go away with coil or spiral
binding. one downside i can think of is that maybe books do not stack well if
bound that way. that is however not a problem for me because i do not care about
how nice a books look when stacked but about its content and ease of consuming
that content. all my notebooks are coil bound and they are convenient to use.
why is it then that most modern books are still bound with that annoying method?
i tried searching the web for an explanation and i could not find any. my only
guess is that people are so used to this horribleness that they do not even
realize things could be better. this is so annoying that if i wanted a printed
version of a book, i would try to get the ebook version, print that and coil
bind it myself. why is this so hard to do in the printing press in the first
place?

the other downside i can think of is that this way it might be harder to search
for a specific book in a bookcase since the book might not have a side with a
title on it. i am not convinced that this is a problem though. i am pretty sure
you could slide a long piece of cardboard or a plastic marker into the coil that
contains the title when you look at it from side. think of this like sliding a
pen into the coil and clipping it to it. when reading the book you pull this
marker out. whenever you finished a reading session you slide the marker back
and put the book back onto the bookcase. you can easily clip other random stuff
to the coil.

and more importantly there is no need to "close" the book. no need for bookmarks
or remembering page numbers. next time you pick up the book, you can start
reading where you left off. in fact all this is pretty awesome! i should totally
start my own book printing business.

# edit from 2021: i've posted this to r/changemyview.

since after 2 years i was still holding this view,
i decided to ask reddit about it at
https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o0z5jj/cmv_books_should_be_wirebound/.

here are the common counterarguments:

- can't stack: hoarding such books would be hard for collectors and bookstores.
  while this is true,
  i'm not sure why i should inconvenience my reading experience for this.
  apparently people don't buy books to read but to show them off.
  i'm not the target audience for most books i suppose.
- lacks durability: if you heavily use a book,
  wirebound books are more likely to break.
  this is probably true too.
  but still, it's not that convincing for me
  while i live in a world full of planned obsolescence. :(
- is costly: to counteract the durability problem,
  higher quality paper will be needed.
  and the lack of established mass production for such books also makes it costlier.
  true... but it's unclear how much costlier it would be.
- use an ebook reader: if my only problem is inconvenience,
  maybe i just need a good quality ebook reader.
  yeah, this is also true and is pretty much what i do.
  ebook readers also explain to me why others aren't complaining about books.

it was a nice discussion.
i learned some nuance from it
but didn't really make me like ordinarily bound books better.
if anything, it made me like my kindle more.
