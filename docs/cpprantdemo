# cpprantdemo: a short dialog about c++ between a cat and a dog.

here's the demo: @/cpprant.

out of curiosity i wanted to create a little javascript dialog demo with the following properties:

- i have a synthesized audio file of two people talking,
- a chat transcript appears as they talk,
- there's a textbox of code that gets updated in real time,
- the user can drag the audio's position and the transcript and code gets updated accordingly.

i've managed to implement that.
wasn't sure that dialog to put into it, went with some silly c++ bashing.

the script is here: @/cpprant.script.
all data is generated from this single file.
i use rhvoice to generate the audio file: @/cpprant.go.

anyway, i can now cross one little project off my bucket list, yay.
