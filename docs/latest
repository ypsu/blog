<h2 id="freewrite">freewrite</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>freewriting is the best adult pacifier.</p>
<p>
adults use pacifiers to calm down babies.
but adults have their own pacifiers too, e.g.:
</p>

<ul><li>
  checking email, facebook, memes;
</li><li>
  snacking on some food or drink (e.g. coffee);
</li><li>
  smoking;
</li><li>
  playing games;
</li><li>
  watching youtube or porn.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
when one is waiting for something, e.g.
</p>

<ul><li>
  a webpage to load;
</li><li>
  waiting for a response in a messaging app;
</li><li>
  compilation to finish (https://xkcd.com/303/);
</li><li>
  waiting to be motivated to start something, aka procrastinating,
</li>
</ul>

<p>
one is tempted to switch to such a pacifying activity.
i guess that&apos;s because most people are very uncomfortable with just waiting.
</p>

<p>
there are two problems with the above pacifiers:
</p>

<ul><li>
  they are addictive and hard to stop so you might spend more time on them
  than on the activity you wanted to do in the first place.
</li><li>
  you lose a lot of momentum with the task due to the context switch.
  e.g. during a coding session&apos;s compilation phase you notice some important email
  and you start writing a response to that.
  you just pretty much throw out 10+ minutes worth of context out of your head.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so what to do instead?
freewrite!
get a notebook and every time you need to wait
and/or have an urge to do something else,
just write out the uncomfortableness instead!
</p>

<p>
this shouldn&apos;t be your notebook for todo lists.
this should be a write only notebook that you just append thoughts to,
which are never to be read again.
</p>

<p>
if you don&apos;t know know what to write,
just write down what is actually happening.
e.g. &quot;i&apos;m waiting for a response from john.
i feel like i should check on my email.
i&apos;m expecting an important email, i wonder i got it already.
probably not.
what should i respond to john if he doesn&apos;t like my idea? [...]&quot;
</p>

<p>
keep your device open at the activity that you are waiting for.
while writing you&apos;ll quickly notice if your webpage finished loading or you received your response
so you can immediately switch back to your previous activity.
with writing you don&apos;t need to wait until you &quot;finish&quot; your pacifier activity.
writing can fill any duration you need to wait and can be easily stopped anytime.
</p>

<p>
it is very weird at the beginning but quite nice once the habit is established.
you&apos;ll lose less context by this
and at the same time it helps you to organize your thoughts in general.
it&apos;s a win-win!
</p>

<h2 id="cooldown">cooldown</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>forcing a wait before letting users exchange messages.</p>
<p>
how do you keep a discourse civil?
</p>

<p>
one approach is moderation or peer review
where another person looks at your message before sending.
they could flag any uncivil behavior that you would need to fix before publishing.
i think this can be pretty good but doesn&apos;t really work for private, one on one conversations
where there is no third party at all.
and the third party is not always predictably responsive.
e.g. what if the moderator or reviewer is on a vacation?
</p>

<p>
here&apos;s another idea: cooldown.
you can split sending a message into three steps:
draft the message, wait for a while (configurable but e.g. 1h), publish the draft.
</p>

<p>
there would be no auto-publish: the publish would be a conscious action.
and an edit would reset the cooldown
so you need to make the weird decision
whether to publish an imperfect message or wait even longer.
</p>

<p>
so the idea is that you don&apos;t send your initial draft,
you yourself review your own message, hopefully in a different, cooler mood
in which you won&apos;t send a rude message.
if the message isn&apos;t worth waiting 1h for,
then it&apos;s maybe better if you don&apos;t send it at all.
</p>

<p>
you can adhere to such rules yourself
but maybe a discussion forum plagued with flamewars could enact this on its members indiscriminately.
it could cool its members down a bit without fully stopping the discussion.
it would definitely drive some people away but that&apos;s good:
large discussion forums are hard to maintain
and bringing down its population count is probably good.
hopefully the people who remain are the ones
who are really motivated to publish their thoughts, not just gut reactions.
and as the community cools, the admins can lower the cooldown duration.
</p>

<p>
i do expect that some members would use browser extensions to auto-publish messages
and defeat the whole purpose of this restriction.
but there&apos;s still the possibility of a user reconsidering a message even if it&apos;s auto-published.
so there is some potential benefit even in this case.
and i&apos;d also expect that only a minority of people would bother installing such extensions
so the overall effect would be still strong.
</p>

<p>
this relates a bit to my previous #/batch post
where i recommended waiting until morning to send messages.
that is pretty much infeasible for most things
but with the cooldown idea one can get to it halfway.
prepare all the drafts one by one
and then pretty much send them at once even during the day.
</p>

<p>
not sure if this is a good idea
but if i ever were to build a discussion forum
(or even something like an anonymous comment section on a blog like this),
i&apos;d definitely try this 3 step method
as an attempt to increase the quality of the messages.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d implement an anonymous comment section like this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  you have an edit box where the user can prepare their message.
</li><li>
  once they complete their draft, they hit the &quot;save draft&quot; button.
</li><li>
  this sends their comment&apos;s hash to the server.
</li><li>
  the server appends a timestamp to that hash and hashes that using a secret salt.
</li><li>
  the server sends back the timestamp and the new hash to the user&apos;s browser.
</li><li>
  the comment form will tell the user to come back in 5 minutes
  and if they still want to publish, they can do so then.
</li><li>
  after 5 minutes they click publish
  and the form sends the previous timestamp and new hash along the contents.
</li><li>
  the server verifies the hash using the secret salt
  and if it checks out, the comment appears.
</li><li>
  for extra protection: increase the cooldown duration with each new message by one minute.
  e.g. after 10 messages the users would need to wait 15 minutes to publish a message.
  this would prevent the comment section from suddenly blowing up
  and encourage moving long discussions to some other place.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
sounds complicated but i think it should be pretty easy to implement
without keeping any extra state on the server.
it doesn&apos;t really protect against a dedicated spammer
but might work fine in the wild until the blog becomes a target.
</p>

<h2 id="batch">batch</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>send emails in the mornings!</p>
<p>
rube goldberg machines are machines
that solve very simple problems in an overcomplicated manner.
it&apos;s quite satisfying to start them:
once you start them, you can just sit back and relax.
the task is now outside of your control.
it might break, it might succeed, but for now you just need to wait and see.
</p>

<p>
whenever i send a document or commit for review,
or i just send an email with questions to someone,
i get a similar feeling.
while i didn&apos;t fully accomplish my task yet,
the task itself is now outside of my control
so i don&apos;t need to worry about it for a little while.
it&apos;s all on other people.
it&apos;s a very stoic approach to task management.
</p>

<p>
the problem at work is that there&apos;s always a lot more tasks to do.
so it&apos;s very hard to get to the &quot;sit back and relax&quot; state.
so here&apos;s an idea: don&apos;t send out your artifacts immediately!
</p>

<p>
keep working at stuff:
prepare docs, commits, email drafts, but hold on to them.
only send them out in the morning
right after you are done with your morning routine
or are interrupted otherwise.
this will accomplish four things:
</p>

<ul><li>
  in the morning you have an easy task to do: send out stuff.
  this means you start out the day productive
  and that feeling motivates you to do more thorough the day.
</li><li>
  if you managed to accumulate multiple artifacts the previous day(s)
  that you can now send out together,
  then you are now pretty much progressing on multiple tasks simultaneously
  without you making any sweat.
  and there&apos;s less guilt about not progressing at all whenever you make a break.
</li><li>
  you protect yourself from the expensive context switches.
  sometimes a response comes in that you could handle in a few minutes.
  but this breaks your flow and in reality costs you a lot more.
  if you can&apos;t respond today anyways,
  you won&apos;t feel a pressure to drop everything to respond right now.
</li><li>
  sometimes other people make you angry and you write an angry response.
  by the next morning you have calmed down
  and you won&apos;t send the angry response at all.
  this way you prevented making some of your relationships worse.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
of course there&apos;s lot of nuance to how to do this
without being annoying to others.
in general you would only do this with your tasks
and you wouldn&apos;t unreasonably slow down the progression of other people&apos;s tasks.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t really follow such a practice myself yet, only sometimes:
e.g. when i suddenly get inspired on a weekend and feel like working.
i might solve a few tasks but i don&apos;t send them out for review on the weekend.
i send them out the next monday.
i always felt good on such mondays and that&apos;s what i&apos;m trying to generalize.
i guess i&apos;ll experiment a bit and see.
