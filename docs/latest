<p>
earlier this year i had this crazy idea that i wanted to learn german.
i looked around and found smartergerman.com
which would allow you to learn german online alone.
it was quite fine for a while
but i think having access to a private teacher is much better.
so i eventually stopped using the site in favor of the teacher,
well, at least as long as my job was reimbursing the lessons.
</p>

<p>
anyways, as i was lurking on a site I&apos;ve seen
that its owner was looking for someone to replicate a tool he has seen online.
this tool basically plays you a video,
and then you have to enter what you heard.
you can keep replaying the audio/video until you got your sentence right.
you can also ask for some hints too.
the guy tried to contact the owners of the tool he found,
but they weren&apos;t responsive at all, hence he looked someone to replicate it.
he wanted to play around with such a tool
and if people like it, he might even add it to his site.
i thought that would be a fun tool to work on.
</p>

<p>
so i volunteered that i can give a stab at it.
he even wanted to pay but i refused since i didn&apos;t want to deal with the taxes.
besides, what i had in mind was quite trivial,
i wouldn&apos;t really ask money for this.
</p>

<p>
for this project i came up with the name &quot;tscriter&quot;.
i meant it as a play on the phrase &quot;transcription tester&quot;.
i created a github project for it and started implementing it.
then we iterated for a while.
i implemented some features, and then he gave me feedback.
working like this was quite nice.
i even added some css after all the prompting.
i think it&apos;s more motivating if you are creating something for someone
rather than when you are creating something for yourself.
</p>

<p>
however as time went on and he played with my tool,
he realized that he wanted to have something different.
he wanted the tool to allow entering the full text,
and then count the mistakes like in a real dictation.
i thought this is also interesting but it should be a separate tool
rather than changing what i was working on at the moment.
i think someone else also volunteered to him
and that someone else did the dictation tool for him
so we sort of lost touch after this.
but he did upload my tool and asked their users to test it.
the results were mixed: some people liked it, some people not.
after seeing that, i guess he didn&apos;t go forward with adding my tool to his site.
</p>

<p>
you can check out the tool at /tscriter.
we were testing it with this smartergerman text: /tscriter#smartergerman.txt
</p>

<p>
i can no longer see any reference to this tool on his site
so i thought i&apos;ll delete the project from github
and put it on my blog to let it rest in peace.
</p>

<p>
before i stopped working on the project, i&apos;ve added a few more features.
all he wanted is just audio playback + a text entry box.
but eventually i figured out i can easily play back youtube videos,
and i can easily fetch the youtube subtitles too.
so i added a feature where you point the tool at a youtube video,
it extracts the subtitles and let&apos;s you type that.
</p>

<p>
however the problem is that there are very few videos
with good quality subtitles.
and with google deprecating apis all the time,
i&apos;d expect it won&apos;t work for long anyways.
so i still retain the capability to define custom text.
one can either host the texts or just paste them directly into the tool.
</p>

<p>
overall, it think it was a nice little project, i learned a lot.
totally would do it again!
try it out and let me know what you think about it!
</p>

<h2 id="kbd">kbd</h2>
<p>
for a very long time i was using a very standard us keyboard with a us layout.
it was a das keyboard with the cherry mx brown switches.
i bought it about 10 years ago and it still works perfectly.
i average about 80 wpm on it.
i got the blank keycap version so that i forced myself to not look at the keys.
i never learned proper typewriting,
so my typing style was whatever that evolved from only using hunt and peck.
</p>

<p>
but one thing was bugging me:
the qwerty layout wasn&apos;t designed with efficiency or ergonomics in mind.
the staggered rows was annoying me most --
i was really inaccurate for the non-main row keys.
so about 8 years ago i learned about ergodox
and thought maybe i should try switching to that.
the design of that had at least some thought in it.
and if i switch i might as well ditch the qwerty layout
for something that also had some effort in it.
but i never made the switch.
i think one of the big reasons was price.
it&apos;s quite expensive and i would need two: one for work, one for home.
but now that most of the tech world switched to wfh,
my excuse sort of evaporated, and i could no longer resist the temptation.
i got one from ergodox-ez since i didn&apos;t want to build my own.
</p>

<p>
then i had to pick a new keyboard layout too.
there were many to choose from: dvorak, colemak, workman, norman, etc.
i went with the norman one since that seemed the newest one.
and has incorporated the lessons of the previous ones and improved on them.
</p>

<p>
so i got my ergodox and i installed norman on it.
the first few days were miserable.
i had less than 10 wpm with it.
every keypress needed several seconds of deliberation
since i didn&apos;t know where the keys were by instinct.
i didn&apos;t have any muscle memory.
it was frustrating to have my thoughts buffered up in my mind,
yet i couldn&apos;t express them, just very slowly.
that actually changed my thinking a little bit temporarily:
i thought and coded in a way that required less typing from me.
i don&apos;t remember how it was different though,
i didn&apos;t make notes about this.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about ergodox is that is super configurable.
it has an online configurator
where you can set up the keys to do whatever you want.
if that&apos;s not enough, then technically you could build your own firmware,
but i never reached that point.
i played a lot with the settings and the key placements.
first, i put space on those big thumb keys,
but then later i realized it&apos;s better if it&apos;s on a closer key.
i also moved the ; key away from it&apos;s default position in norman.
i use that key surprisingly often in the vim and tmux context,
often with a modifier (in tmux) so i thought it&apos;s better on a big fat key.
</p>

<p>
i also experimented with its autoshift feature.
the idea is that if you hold down a key long enough (175 ms by default)
then you get the shifted version.
the downside is that you can&apos;t keep a key held down for an autorepeat.
though this can be worked around by disabling autoshift in other layers.
i tried using this for a while.
i only enabled it for the number row and the symbols.
i liked the idea i could type anything without the shift.
but i never managed to get the timing right so i made a lot of typos
and later i felt it was slowing me down, so i eventually disabled this feature.
</p>

<p>
but the idea of the autoshift still intrigues me somewhat.
i wish there were tactile switches with two levels.
if you pressed down harder, then the other switch would activate.
so a light press would trigger &apos;4&apos;, a hard press would trigger &apos;$&apos;.
it&apos;s a bit tricky but i think it&apos;s not impossible to implement this.
on the other hand it might be a be bad idea.
one would need to watch their pressure this way too
and thus it might end up just a net drag over the long term.
but still, it&apos;s an interesting idea.
</p>

<p>
anyways, for reference, here&apos;s my current layout:
https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/QXjem.
i&apos;ll keep this up do date as i further change my layout.
</p>

<p>
i started using a few online tools to track my wpm.
every morning i measured my speed and looked at the improvement rate.
i even used sites like keybr.com to improve my improvement rate.
my improvement rate was about 10 wpm per week for the first 4 weeks.
so i could reach about 50 wpm on a good day after a month.
the progress since then is much slower.
i&apos;m still at around 60 wpm currently.
</p>

<p>
huge gains in wpm wasn&apos;t even my primary goal.
i think at the 70-80 range, the typing speed stops mattering,
since i can&apos;t think fast enough to go at it other than for short bursts.
however my goal was to improve my accuracy.
i had a feeling that i&apos;m a bit inaccurate on qwerty,
and i suspected it was because the illogical staggered layout.
but i&apos;m quite inaccurate on my ergodox too.
well, it&apos;s partly because of the new layout,
but even as i got familiar with it, i still make a lot of mistakes,
and then i have to retype a lot.
this is actually what currently tanks my wpm.
</p>

<p>
i was hoping the online tools could improve this.
but all of them are super forgiving when it comes to typos.
they let you go back and fix your mistakes.
what i really wanted is something that really drills correct writing.
i haven&apos;t found one so i started thinking of making my own tool.
i wanted an interface that shows me one specific text,
and keeps me practicing on that singular text until i master it.
this reminded me of the trackmania game from nadeo.
it&apos;s a car racing game where you get an elaborate track,
and you have race through it in as little time as possible.
you then get a bronze/silver/gold medal based on your performance.
it can even show you your replay in the form of a ghost car.
i wanted to have something like this just for typing.
i tried searching for &quot;typemania&quot;.
it had a lot of results but nothing useful.
so i decided to make my own html5 game and called it peckmania
in order to bypass all the bad results
in case someone else is looking for this too.
</p>

<p>
the resulting game is at /peckmania.
</p>

<p>
although trackmania lets you make mistakes and has checkpoints
i didn&apos;t add support for backspacing to delete the last character/word.
i guess i could make something like that, but i didn&apos;t bother.
i want to be able to learn to type long sentences without mistakes,
so i want to make the game as punishing as possible.
otherwise i won&apos;t learn to slow down to my still accurate writing speed.
if i can master this, i could then write even with closed eyes!
</p>

<p>
i also liked the medal and the ghostcar features in trackmania,
so i implemented ranking and typeline.
the biggest rank is for 100 wpm.
nobody needs to be faster than that anyways.
for reference 100 wpm is about 8.3 characters per second.
it&apos;s quite insane and some people can do even 150 wpm with ease.
the typeline is a visualization of a typing run:
it displays which key was pressed at which time on a horizontal timeline.
you could technically see which sections or combinations were fast or slow.
</p>

<p>
initially i wasn&apos;t sure how will i implement the typeline.
i was thinking of a fancy graphical rendering logic using the html5 canvas.
but one needs to be very careful to make that look good on all resolutions.
after a lot of thinking on how to make it all look nice,
i decided i should just stick to black and white text.
that&apos;s super simple to deal with.
implementing fancy graphics can take ages and i&apos;d never finish then.
but sticking to a barebones ui allowed me
to actually finish all the important features,
even if they are all presented in a somewhat non-traditional interface.
but at least i completed something.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m glad i stuck to black and white text
because i can now easily use the whole thing on a monochrome monitor.
yes, i&apos;m using a special monochrome eink monitor right now
and i have lot of pent up sadness about the state of accessibility on the web,
but let me save those for a later post.
</p>

<p>
when i started on peckmania,
i still had two keyboards connected to my primary machine,
hence i added support for &quot;save slots&quot;.
so if anybody else is in a similar situation, they can switch between the slots
to track their progress on the different keyboards or layouts separately.
</p>

<p>
i also wanted to make it easy to experiment with different texts,
so i made it easy to import a completely custom level set.
i even included a few default ones like german, hungarian, programming.
but one can just simply change the text after the hash in the url bar
and can train on any text they can enter there.
</p>

<p>
peckmania saves all the results locally.
just like how in old games it was easy to move savedata around,
i wanted to have a similar usability feature here too.
in the old days the games put things into files
but that is a bit hard in the age of the browsers.
i realized that one could just simply use the clipboard for this.
so i just added event listeners for the clipboard events
and manipulated those for the export/import features.
i think it&apos;s quite neat,
maybe this sort of pattern should be more common in the world.
i ensured that all the data is simple text,
so it&apos;s very easy for the users to move it around,
or even track it in a version control system if they wished so.
if they do that they could even build some custom stats over time.
</p>

<p>
anyways, my point is that i think i added all the important features i wished
and now i can pretty much consider this little game as done.
all i need to do now is to practice with it
and see if my accuracy improves over time or now.
we&apos;ll see.
</p>

<p>
anyways, back to ergodox.
initially i experienced some slight discomfort in my thumbs.
that lasted quite a few weeks as i was using it.
but now that i got used to the keyboard, it&apos;s not really there anymore.
i think moving the spaces to closer keys helped.
that thumb block is really not for such a common key like space.
i also feel that on a standard keyboard some keys are easier to reach.
the middle fat keys still feel a bit unnatural to press.
but maybe with time this will also improve.
otherwise, now that i&apos;m getting used to it, i start liking my ergodox.
i wouldn&apos;t really recommend it for average users,
but if you spend all your day in front of a computer in a static corner,
i think it might worth a try.
but don&apos;t be discouraged with the few weeks of reduced productivity
until you reach back the same throughput as with an ordinary keyboard.
just keep practicing with it.
</p>

<p>
as for the norman layout:
i think it&apos;s a good layout once i got the hang of it.
more stuff on the main row makes it easier to type english text for me.
and i didn&apos;t lose all my qwerty skills either.
after a few minutes of qwerty typing my brain switches back into qwerty mode
and i can type the same as before, maybe with a bit higher typo rate.
i don&apos;t do qwerty on the ergodox though.
i think having two completely different keyboard helps with this switching.
but one needs to regularly practice the switching
otherwise one is likely to forget about the other layout.
</p>

<p>
however i still have a lot of trouble when it comes to writing symbols.
i guess that&apos;s partly because i didn&apos;t practice those as much as english.
but hopefully with time i&apos;ll catch up on those too.
</p>

<p>
i also didn&apos;t remap any vim, tmux or i3 keys.
navigating in those became a bit painful
but i sort of got the hang of it eventually.
</p>

<p>
in summary: currently i&apos;m experiencing lower speed and higher typo rate,
but at least my curiosity is sated, doesn&apos;t bug me anymore.
so overall i&apos;m glad i tried the switch
and looks like i&apos;ll be using my norman ergodox for a while
to see if i can get back to a similar performance long term.
but this is just my stockholm syndrome speaking so take it with a grain of salt.
</p>

<p>
and remember, if peckmania is something that you&apos;d like to try,
it&apos;s at /peckmania.
</p>

<p>
edit: i keep some progress data at /kbdlog.

<h2 id="enacc">enacc</h2>
<p>
i&apos;m quite the sucker for temptations and vices.
i&apos;ve managed to avoid the worst ones
and fortunately no vice takes up too much time from me on average.
but sometimes i have a flareup and then i tend to go overboard with things.
i decide to check out a manga, an anime or a game,
and then i&apos;m spending 10 hours per day consuming it up to several weeks.
i guess i have issues with moderation.
during those flareups this can really affect my general productivity.
in the past i had all sorts of addictions
but i managed to cure myself out of them.
i do that by avoiding the triggers and resisting the temptations.
but sometimes it takes quite a long time for me to enact countermeasures.
here&apos;s a random sampling of addictions i have or had in the past:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much time on reddit or hackernews,
</li><li>
  too much time gaming,
</li><li>
  eating too much junk food,
</li><li>
  reading too many blogs,
</li><li>
  watching too much youtube, anime, or movies,
</li><li>
  obsessively checking my email,
</li><li>
  fapping too much.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in moderation they are fine,
but when i go overboard, i often regret all the wasted time and energy.
i regret not spending the time on stuff i know i wouldn&apos;t regret.
here&apos;s a sampling of stuff after which i feel somewhat good:
</p>

<ul><li>
  finishing some work related tasks,
</li><li>
  writing a blog post, demo, game,
</li><li>
  exchanging emails with people,
</li><li>
  spending time with people i like.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if i have a flareup of one of the former activities,
these preferred activities get much less attention,
which means i don&apos;t feel very good about myself.
all of these good things require a lot of energy to start them,
and if the activation energy is too high,
i&apos;m more tempted to procrastinate with the former activities.
</p>

<p>
i was thinking what options i have to help myself.
one common tip against bad habits is to replace them with different habits.
that sort of works but it&apos;s quite hard.
and it doesn&apos;t really help with the flareups,
where you spend a lot of time in a short burst on an activity.
i want something that would force me to moderate myself
and works regardless of activity.
</p>

<p>
my sudden idea is to assign an &quot;energy cost&quot; for those regretful activities.
i then have a limited supply of energy and i have to budget it thoughtfully.
if i have a lot of energy saved, i can let myself have some fun.
if i&apos;m low on energy, i can only allow the simplest things like checking email.
this still allows me to do things in bursts (that&apos;s my preference),
but thanks to the tracking
i can now rely on the system that it will prevent me from going overboard.
</p>

<p>
what should be the source of this energy?
well, these days i spend all my days indoors thanks to the covid19 lockdowns.
i just sit all day long.
i don&apos;t get any exercise at all.
therefore i decided to gain energy from doing some simple exercises.
the goal isn&apos;t to get buffed from these exercises,
but to have less zero days.
zero day means a day where you didn&apos;t do anything useful.
the goal is to avoid them.
so i guess this little gamification could help me avoid them.
</p>

<p>
i started this system when i was writing this post,
and i felt that it already helped me to curb my email checking addiction.
i don&apos;t want to waste my hard earned energy points on this silly habit.
there&apos;s no need to check it more than a few times a day.
this allows me to focus better
and makes it actually possible to write this post.
one could say that i&apos;m actually quantifying my opportunity cost
and i&apos;m using my loss aversion tendency to battle the bad habits.
</p>

<p>
to make things harder, i track energy in multiple dimensions.
each exercise type i track gets its own dimension.
for example i can start with three dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  pushup: 1 pushup = 1 pushup energy
</li><li>
  pullup: 1 pullup = 2 pullup energy
</li><li>
  squat: 2 squats = 1 squat energy
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in this example different exercises convert to different amount of energy.
pullups are hard for me, so i&apos;d get more energy from a single pushup.
squats are relatively easy, so i&apos;d need to do more from it for a single point.
</p>

<p>
to use up some energy, i subtract that energy from all dimensions!
for example if i have pushup:7 pullup:6 squat:3 energy levels,
and checking on email costs 2 energy points,
then after that i&apos;d have pushup:5 pullup:4 squat:1 energy remaining.
i&apos;d need to do 2 squats again before i could check on my email again.
i subtract from all dimensions to ensure my exercises are somewhat balanced.
the goal of the system is to stay in the positive range
and rack up enough buffer
so that i can enjoy some of the bad activities when i feel down.
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s super easy to add and remove exercise dimensions as i see fit.
maybe i get some dumbbells and then i can add a dumbbell curls.
maybe some day i want to focus on being more outside.
then i can add an outside dimension
which will result in 2 energy points for every minute spent outside.
or if pushups become to easy,
i can just change my accounting so that i need 2 pushups for each energy point.
or maybe i break a leg bone, then i can remove tracking squat for a while.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about using exercises is
that after an exercise i feel more motivated to do sensible stuff.
exercise somehow wakes up my spirit.
so this system not only limits my bad habits,
but it also motivates me to spend time on my preferred activities.
and getting some exercise out of it is not a bad deal either.
i tried going to gym a while ago.
i&apos;ve lasted a couple months but i found it incredibly boring.
i felt that there was just no point to it.
but this system gives me some goal for the exercises.
i understand that these little exercises don&apos;t substitute real exercise.
however i&apos;m more likely to do it several times per day
which is good from a &quot;take a break from the computer&quot; perspective at least.
by the way, this style of training is called &quot;grease the groove&quot;,
although i&apos;m not taking this experiment seriously enough to call it a training.
</p>

<p>
i also have a lot of flexibility over costs too.
for example i can start with this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1 point for each minute of youtube, anime, tv watched or game played,
</li><li>
  2 points for checking on email,
</li><li>
  10 points for checking on memes or aggregators,
</li><li>
  10 points for eating some junk food.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the costs are arbitrary
and subject to constant tweaking based on how i feel about my habits.
in order for me to binge watch a long anime,
i have to buffer up a lot of energy.
which is good, because at least my body got something out of it.
and since i couldn&apos;t watch said anime until i buffered up enough energy,
i probably spent a lot of time on doing nice stuff in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t plan to use this as an excuse to restart my old bad habits.
i&apos;d still heavily avoid hackernews for example.
one visit to that site and my day is ruined.
it&apos;s more for protection against accidental visits or accidental new habits.
if i notice i started doing something that i regret afterwards,
i can quickly assign some cost to it and thus limit myself.
</p>

<p>
i also put an upper limit of 1000 points on the values in the dimensions.
for example that&apos;s about 16.5 hours of anime watching.
this way i can be certain
that i won&apos;t burn more than 2 days in a row just on a single anime.
the other function of the upper limit,
is to signal that an exercise is maybe too easy.
if i can easily reach 1000 in a dimension, maybe i should make it harder.
e.g. if i could easily make 1000 pushups in a few days (i wish),
i could change the accounting to have 2 pushups only mean 1 point.
or maybe i could pushups with a weighted vest.
</p>

<p>
although the system allows the energy levels to go below 0,
but i wouldn&apos;t allow that to happen (hopefully).
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s relatively easy to track this on pen and paper.
all you need is a table.
each row should have a timestamp (mmdd hhmm format to save space),
and the latest energy levels for each dimension.
suppose it&apos;s july 17 and you start with 10 energy points in each dimension,
check on the email, then do another 2 pushups, then watch a cat video next day.
your table would look like this:
</p>

<pre>
  timestamp | pushup | pullup | squat | comment
  ----------+--------+--------+-------+--------
  0717 0800 |     10 |     10 |    10 |
       0817 |      8 |      8 |     8 | email
       0820 |     10 |        |       |
  0718 0703 |      6 |      4 |     4 | 4min cat video
</pre>

<p>
the comment column is optional, i think i would leave it empty most of the time.
and if the level is the same as in the previous row, i can leave that empty too.
timestamp is also optional to track.
if you do it, you can then graph your energy levels over time.
even if you do that, tracking hour and minute might be overkill,
maybe just note the day and track only that.
</p>

<p>
in my case i spend almost all my time in front of the computer,
so obviously i made a script for myself to do this tracking.
i made a little &quot;enacc&quot; tool and it logs all my changes into the ~/.enacc file.
enacc stands for energy accounting tool.
i can write &quot;enacc 2&quot; and it subtracts 2 from all dimensions.
then it prints the current stats.
i can write &quot;enacc pushup 10&quot; and it logs that i gained 10 pushup points.
i can just write &quot;enacc&quot; and it displays usage and the comments from ~/.enacc.
i keep my current dimensions and costs in the comments in that file,
so this way i can easily remind myself of my commitments.
here&apos;s an example run:
</p>

<pre>
  $ enacc
  enacc - energy accounter.
  usage 1: enacc [dim val]...
  usage 2: enacc [val]
  dim is either &apos;sub&apos; or one of the energy dimensions.
  dim &apos;sub&apos; subtracts val from each energy dimension.
  otherwise val is added to the specific dimension.
  val on its own is the same as &apos;sub val&apos;.
  ~/.enacc file comments and energy levels:
  # dimensions:
  # - push: 1 ordinary pushup.
  # - pull: 1 inverted row with the help of a desk.
  # - jump: 2 jumping jumps for each energy point.
  # costs:
  # - checking email or running the todo script: 2
  # - for each minute of video entertainment: 1
  # - for each minute of gaming: 1
  # - checking on memes or aggregators: 10
  # - eating junk food: 10

i track a full timestamp here because for computers that&apos;s not a problem.
i keep this script in my utilities repo here:
https://github.com/ypsu/cfg/blob/master/utils/enacc.c
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s a linux commandline utility though.
there are probably gazillion more mature apps doing the same.
maybe they can make the tracking even simpler.
i don&apos;t know, i haven&apos;t researched this area online,
i might have missed some nice improvements.
i came up with this on my own
after being frustrated with watching too much anime recently.
maybe try the paper tracking first
before investing too much time in a complicated tool though.
</p>

<p>
i also don&apos;t track on what i wasted my energy points on.
it would just add more toil tracking this and i&apos;d be more likely to give up.
i want the process to be as easy as possible, so i only care about the numbers.
to be fair, i wouldn&apos;t even care about using a log format in my tool,
and just have like 3 numbers in a text file representing the actual levels.
the only reason i use the log format because then i can easily append to it.
i don&apos;t like rewriting files because it&apos;s brittle from coding perspective.
but appending to files is usually a very safe and easy operation to implement.
just think about tracking this on paper:
appending is the only sensible way to do it.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t actually know if i&apos;ll be able to commit myself to this system long term.
but uncertainty should stop me from trying random stuff.
it&apos;s definitely worth a try and see how it goes.
</p>

<h2 id="pens">pens</h2>
<p>
i quite like to write on paper.
it just feels oddly satisfying to draw letters nicely.
if there&apos;s no time pressure,
then i prefer writing on paper to writing on the computer.
sometimes i even write my emails or blog posts in my notebook first.
but most of the time i write just to think.
simply writing down my thoughts often cuts my mental deadlocks.
circular or obsessive thoughts are very easy to spot in writing.
and if you spot them, it&apos;s much easier to avoid them.
so as long as i &quot;think&quot; via writing, my &quot;thinking&quot; is more effective.
</p>

<p>
anyways, writing requires pens, and i just wanted to note my preferences.
maybe the world will make more pens like them thanks to this post, who knows.
i didn&apos;t give pens much thought for a long time.
i just thought all of them are crappy
until i learned that there are nice ones too.
it was during my 2nd year in university,
when a freshman roommate showed me his pen.
it was a uniball 0.38 signo dx (um-151).
i really liked how thin the writing was.
i started using one.
the ink was fast drying too,
so i had much less smudging,
and my hands stopped being all ink all the time.
i then ordered a box of 0.28 ones straight from america.
that was a very wise decision.
those pens lasted my whole university time.
</p>

<p>
the reason i like fine lines is because i use relatively small letters.
i&apos;m quite myopic, about -5d (and worsening).
that means i see clearly only up to 20cm.
so i keep my head bove the paper about that distance.
small letters let me have enough space in a small area.
and for small letters i really need a fine pen.
</p>

<p>
now i live in switzerland and those signo dx pens are hard to come by.
so now i&apos;m testing the sakura pigma microns.
i only started using them a few weeks ago.
it was a bit weird initially since it is a plastic needle tip pen.
i didn&apos;t use such a pen before.
but they feel super nice to write with.
they are not super thin though.
even the smallest, 0.05 version feels about the same as the 0.38 signo dx.
side note: some pens report the nib size, others report the resulting line size.
no idea why they can&apos;t all use the same measurement to number their pens.
</p>

<p>
the only annoying thing about the pigma micron is that it is brittle.
the problem is that its tip slowly goes back inside its metal frame.
perhaps i&apos;m using way too much pressure while writing.
after a while it becomes very inconvenient or unable to write,
even though there&apos;s plenty of ink remaining.
and it&apos;s not something that can be easily repaired.
or at least i&apos;m not skilled enough to repair such a fine instrument.
if these pens wouldn&apos;t have this flaw,
i&apos;d be happy to use them instead of the signo dx pens.
but if i have to choose,
i think i&apos;d still stick with the 0.28 signo dx pens.
another advantage of the signo dx pens is,
that you can clearly see the amount of the remaining ink.
the pigma microns lack this feature.
not that i ever managed to write one dry.
</p>

<p>
btw, i understand not everyone likes small letters or fine lines.
if i were to write something for others to read,
i might use bigger letters and thicker pens.
i recently tried the uniball eye micro (ub-150).
it is quite thick, but also very nice to write with.
i&apos;d probably use that one for such writing (or a thicker pigma micron).
</p>

<p>
as for paper, i use a spiraled a5 graph ruled notebook.
the grid is really helpful in nicely aligning my text or sometimes a drawing.
i don&apos;t really like to use a completely clean paper.
i don&apos;t think i have a preference about paper weight.
if the paper is smooth and the ink doesn&apos;t bleed to the other side, i&apos;m happy.
</p>

<p>
so i like to handwrite.
do i like reading other people&apos;s handwriting?
hell no!
most people simply can&apos;t write readably.
i even seen people who have very &quot;aesthetically&quot; looking writing,
but it was still unreadable to me.
during school some people did sometimes note that my writing is a bit ugly,
but at the same time it was super rare that someone asked for a clarification.
so even if my writing is ugly, at least it&apos;s somewhat readable.
that&apos;s the important part.
i guess people just don&apos;t really care about readability these modern times.
handwriting is a lost art.
btw, if curious about my handwriting, i took a photo of a page of my writing.
it&apos;s at /pens.jpg.
this one is quite ugly though.
i usually write much nicer if i expect others to read it.
i didn&apos;t know i&apos;ll take a photo back then, so i didn&apos;t spend effort on niceness.
at least you can see my ugly side.
in any case, i wouldn&apos;t really want to communicate via handwriting.
i prefer reading nicely printed text instead (if short then screen is fine too).
</p>

<p>
btw, one disclaimer to these preferences:
i&apos;m no big pen guru.
i haven&apos;t tried many pens.
so i constructed my preferences from a small sample size.
if anyone knows cheap, available pens i&apos;d like, then let me know.
</p>

<p>
anyways, to summarize,
my favorite pens are (in this order, assuming their finest version):
</p>

<ul><li>
  uniball signo dx (um-151)
</li><li>
  sakura pigma micron
</li><li>
  uniball eye micro (ub-150)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
edit: not long after writing this post, i had an idea.
i realized that i found it quite uncomfortable
to write on the left side of the notebook.
my wrist rested on the spiral.
and it was really annoying whenever i had to write near the right margin.
the spiral was getting in the way of the pen.
so i decided that from now on i&apos;ll just flip the notebook for the left side.
so every time i start a new page, i have to flip the notebook.
or more specifically: rotate the notebook 180 degrees.
/pens.jpg shows the old style.
in the new style i&apos;d have flipped the notebook.
the sentences would always start at the spiral, no matter where i write.
this would be annoying if i wanted to read the notebook,
but for me it&apos;s mostly write only.
the reading inconvenience of the flipping is worth the writing convenience.
i&apos;ll totally do this from now and see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
edit2: i came across the muji 0.38mm gel pens.
they are similar to the sigma dx but can be bought here in switzerland in muji.
muji is some sort of retailer for random japanese stuff, i think.
it&apos;s not perfect though.
i&apos;m not sure if i got a faulty unit or all of them are like this,
but the one i tried needed more pressure to ensure the ball is rolling.
if i didn&apos;t do that (with micros i use barely any) the ink just skipped.
but i could get used to this too.
it&apos;s a nice pen.
but after using the microns for a while, i might like them better than ballpens.
the &quot;needle goes back to its cave&quot; is the only thing that annoys me. :(
</p>

<p>
edit3: i no longer flip my notebook each time i fill a page.
what i do instead is that i simply skip the other side of the page.
this way i can always easily refer to the previous pages
and write at the same time though i don&apos;t usually refer back.
i only flip the notebook when i filled the right side of the notebook.
then i go backwards in the flipped notebook so i still write on the right side.
very convenient.
