<p>
i had a terrible track record of finishing anything i&apos;ve set out to do.
however i changed four things recently
and now i feel quite good about the progress on my little goals.
</p>

<p>
i often have an idea of a game or a tool that i&apos;d like to see.
sometimes i even start working on a demo for it.
but once the initial motivation is gone, i just pretty much abandon the project.
and then i feel bad about myself, and i wonder what&apos;s wrong with me.
i usually explain it &quot;ah surely work is draining my energy&quot;
and that &quot;all i need to do is retire and then i&apos;ll have energy for all this&quot;.
but then over time i started tweaking things and i&apos;ve noticed some nice changes.
in my case there are four components at play here:
</p>

<ul><li>
  scope of my goals or projects.
</li><li>
  maintaining the motivation.
</li><li>
  finding the time for the project.
</li><li>
  make project work a routine.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
scope
</p>

<p>
i had a very simple solution to the scope problem.
unless something is clearly trivial and finishable in very little time,
i changed all the goals from &quot;implement this&quot; to &quot;write a blog post about this&quot;.
now all my plans are suddenly feasible without retirement.
from past experience, writing down those ideas already give me the satisfaction
that i&apos;d get from implementing the stuff.
this is also a parenting 101 trick:
when the kid wants something that you don&apos;t want to give them,
often giving them in fantasy calms them down more than enough.
sometimes the fantasy satisfies even more than the actual reality
since everything looks and feels better in imagination.
</p>

<p>
i know some people are afraid of writing down their ideas
because they &quot;fear&quot; that other people steal them
and then make all the money that would be &quot;rightfully&quot; theirs.
for me there&apos;s nothing wrong with this.
that&apos;s actually the best outcome!
it means that the idea resonates with people
and when some other person implements it all
then it&apos;s like improving the world from an armchair without lifting a finger.
as for the money making bit:
i have a stable, good job, i don&apos;t care about the money bit.
actually, i don&apos;t even want to care about the money bit.
tbf, none of my queued up ideas are something that one could make money with.
i just wanted to mention that i wouldn&apos;t mind sharing business ideas either.
i wish other people would also be less secretive about their ideas.
sometimes it&apos;s quite hard to talk with such secretive people.
</p>

<p>
anyways, the point is that my plan is now just to write down more ideas
rather than actually try to implement them.
i have this single &quot;ideas&quot; plain text file with lots of junk in it.
with this approach i think it would be feasible for me to drain it.
it always bothered me that this file just keeps growing
and i never do anything about it.
i&apos;d totally want it to become an empty file.
if i can do that, i&apos;d feel like i reached the nirvana.
and maybe when i&apos;m old, retired and time millionaire,
i can just look at my blog posts and select some idea from there
so it&apos;s not like that the idea is lost after i got it out of my system.
</p>

<p>
however i still implement some ideas.
but only if i know it won&apos;t take ages.
ideally something that would only need a few hours, tops few days.
i tried implementing fps games in the past but then i abandoned them.
nowadays i&apos;d try to implement a single gun, and just reuse the doom maps.
so then i don&apos;t need to think about content at all,
i just need to make the existing content work with my engine,
which makes the project much smaller in scope.
makes it more achievable if i ever decide to work on something like this.
i even wrote about this idea in /shooter.
</p>

<p>
motivation
</p>

<p>
a problem with some of the longer projects is
that i eventually run out of steam.
i stop caring about the idea.
for one, my little endeavours don&apos;t really have a target audience.
there&apos;s nobody to please, there&apos;s nobody that would nag me to finish my goals.
i&apos;m aware of the idea of accountability partners, but i never tried that
because i&apos;m way too asocial to ask people to care about my silly things.
</p>

<p>
and besides, with bigger projects is often unclear when is it &quot;done&quot;.
if you work on a game and you are making everything,
you could always add one more feature, weapon, map.
or i once worked on a silly programming language
but i gave up when i had to start working on its standard library.
it felt just much work that nobody would care about anyways.
</p>

<p>
reducing the scope just enough that i can complete it in a few days helps.
then i don&apos;t need to struggle with the motivation.
however even small projects are often hard to finish
especially if i take a longer break (e.g. a vacation) in the middle of it.
when i come back, i see all the pending tasks needing completion,
and i just can&apos;t decide where to start again anymore.
it might be analysis paralysis.
</p>

<p>
i realized i need a rather softer way to get back into a project
every time i sit down to work on it.
i noticed that breaking down the tasks into trivial steps
and writing those steps down really helps.
i don&apos;t mean breaking down all the steps but just the immediate ones.
</p>

<p>
i started having a plain text file called &quot;tasks&quot; for my projects.
each line in it is a &quot;task&quot;.
there are two types of tasks:
</p>

<ul><li>
  relatively straightforward tasks that i can finish in about 10 minutes,
</li><li>
  large tasks, that need further breakdown.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
to keep the format simple, i just simply prefix the latter tasks with &apos;!&apos;.
when i start out a project, i map out all the tasks i plan to do,
generally in the form of large tasks.
i then break the tasks down into smaller ones as i go.
e.g. for this blog post i could for instance have the following tasks:
</p>

<ul><li>
  mention analysis paralysis
</li><li>
  mention task types
</li><li>
  explain how i process the tasks
</li><li>
  ! explain the time component
</li><li>
  ! explain the routine component
</li>
</ul>

<p>
then i just go from top to the bottom and work on the tasks.
if the topmost task is a large (!) task,
then my task is to break it down and replace it with smaller tasks,
that i&apos;m actually capable of doing almost any time.
as you can see in the above example, the topmost tasks are simple ones.
</p>

<p>
in the old times i tried to juggle the breakdown in my head.
however being explicit about this really helps.
especially being methodical about going from top to bottom,
i no longer feel paralysed by the remaining work,
since i can see the end right in front of me.
and i don&apos;t really need to think hard about the next item
to tackle at any given moment since that&apos;s given too.
and it&apos;s quite satisfying to see the todo items disappearing
as i&apos;m committing my changes.
all i need now is to give the project some dedicated time.
if i do that, then i certainly make progress,
and making progress is often quite motivating on its own.
</p>

<p>
time
</p>

<p>
i believe that the time aspect was one of the most crucial aspects for me.
i tried to work on my hobby projects either on the weekends
or the evenings after work.
but the time available for me was very spotty.
the weekend usually didn&apos;t work out since i had to tend my family.
in fact tending my family even frustrated me a bit
since i couldn&apos;t use that time for my own stuff.
the evenings didn&apos;t really work out reliably either.
my kid goes to bed at somewhat random time
which means some days i have more time, some days i have less,
and that was frustrating.
especially if i have less time remaining, i don&apos;t feel like starting anything
since i feel that i won&apos;t be able to achieve anything.
and besides, by the end of the day i was tired,
i was at the lowest &quot;energy levels&quot;, least motivated.
</p>

<p>
when my motivation was very high,
i did manage to make some progress in the evenings and on some lucky weekends,
but i did not make steady progress, it was just sporadic progress.
i thought that my official work is my primary blocker here,
and that if i retired, i&apos;d be able to work on these things.
all i need is just struggle through my work years.
i was wrong.
</p>

<p>
earlier this year i decided to track my myopia progression.
this entails me regularly measuring my focus reach with a measuring tape.
later i&apos;ll write a post about this
but for now the point is that i had a developed a regular habit.
initially, while the motivation was high. i measured multiple times a day.
then once i got the technique and the logging mechanics down,
i wanted to minimize the time i spend on this,
so i decided that i&apos;d measure myself once daily.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve set up a little daily reminder for myself
(see the reminder file in my /task post for my reminder mechanics).
so basically this reminder was the first thing i&apos;ve seen each morning,
which meant it was the first thing i did
whenever i first sat down in front of my machine.
i&apos;ve noticed that doing this little thing each morning wasn&apos;t a big effort.
</p>

<p>
later this year i got a new keyboard with a new layout (see my /kbd post).
i decided to track my typing speed once a day in the morning too.
so each morning i measured my eyes and my typing speed.
those were my &quot;dailies&quot;.
i found it actually quite nice to have something &quot;done&quot; each day.
and i could do this even on the weekend mornings
if i decided to wake up before everyone else.
so i decided to wake up around 6am every day or a bit sooner if i could manage.
in the summer times it&apos;s easier for me to wake up earlier thanks to the sun.
but this meant i couldn&apos;t stay up too late,
so i started having a &quot;go to bed alarm&quot; too and i went to bed at 10pm every day.
</p>

<p>
so there i was, up early in the morning and i could see from my apartment window
that all the other people were still sleeping.
it was quite a nice feeling being awake alone in the world.
it felt like the right &quot;me time&quot;.
it felt like this is the time i should be doing something productive.
so i decided to use these mornings to make progress on my personal projects.
</p>

<p>
it worked out great.
it turns out i&apos;m a morning person, mornings is when i have to most energy,
morning is when my motivation is at the highest levels.
and in the mornings i have more time flexibility too.
if i need a few more minutes to finish something,
i just start my work a bit later.
in the time of the work from home this is quite easy to achieve.
</p>

<p>
routine
</p>

<p>
i started doing this morning ritual for my todo items
when i was setting up a new raspberry pi for my new eink screen.
this contained lot of tasks, including tweaking xterm source
so that it completely ignores colors on this machine.
delving into a foreign codebase is a bit scary for me,
but breaking down the tasks into very manageable pieces like
&quot;download the source&quot;, &quot;build it&quot;, &quot;make it work&quot;, &quot;grep for color&quot;, etc
really helped to maintain momentum.
and i did all this before checking my emails or todo items for the day.
avoiding the reality in the morning helped me to focus on my tasks,
i wouldn&apos;t start obsessing about the daily churn that i have in front of me.
</p>

<p>
once i was done with the setup,
i decided to use my mornings to finish /peckmania.
that worked out great too.
then i decided to make a tool for myself to better manage my issues at work.
it worked greatly, i managed to finish what i&apos;ve set to.
working on small little projects in the mornings became a routine.
i&apos;m writing this post in the mornings too.
</p>

<p>
and it was a good routine:
it meant that every morning i achieved something, even if a little thing.
it also lightened my mood, i felt a bit more productive at work too.
i no longer had &quot;zero days&quot; where i achieved absolutely nothing
which usually led to feeling a bit sad afterwards.
if i missed a morning, i felt an uneasiness until i did my dailies.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s another thing that really helped to not break the routine so far:
not trying to do large things in parallel.
if i want to read a book, watch through a tv show, play a video game,
now i queue it up as &quot;project&quot;.
i just consume such things after i finished my current project.
and i do them primarily in the morning.
this way i have much fewer regretful thoughts about
what i should be doing instead while binge watching a new anime.
i know that i can enjoy that show or game without regret,
since i&apos;m between little projects,
so it&apos;s like a mini holiday that i earned for myself.
</p>

<p>
eventually i picked up a few more routine habits over time.
since i&apos;m in switzerland, i feel like i should have some german comprehension.
therefore i&apos;m reading a page or two of german text every morning
and then look up and write down all the unknown words i encounter in it.
i use the online linguee site for this and with my eink screen it&apos;s quite nice
that i still don&apos;t actually have to look at some bright screen in the morning.
my computer time in the morning is almost like reading a book.
hopefully over time this will improve my german vocabulary
and i&apos;ll be able to navigate this german world a little bit better.
actually this became the first routine i do in the morning,
since some slow reading and writing is a very nice way to wake up.
</p>

<p>
in the old times, while i lived in dublin, i used to walk a lot every day.
that&apos;s no longer true in zürich, especially now with all the work from home.
so i decided to reinstate some morning walks in the nearby small forest.
the fresh morning air is very nice.
i just wish the forest was bigger so that i could walk more.
</p>

<p>
i also changed my evening structure.
in the old days i just used to watch youtube or read the internet
until i got bored and went to bed.
for one, i now go to bed at 22:00 quite punctually.
but before that i try to avoid the computer from 20:00 or so.
i just take my notebook and freeform write into it
about anything that comes to my mind, basically reflecting.
i just really like the feeling of freewriting.
this usually involves thinking about future plans and what i should be doing.
a lot of good things have come out of this.
i decided to do that german reading practice
after hours of thinking what easy and fun thing i could do to learn some german.
even deciding to start walking again was thanks to a lot of reflecting.
without all this reflecting i feel like i&apos;m on autopilot
and never really consider trying new things, so i really need it.
another benefit of just simply writing rather than consuming something is
that it helps me start feeling tired sooner which in turn helps fall asleep.
</p>

<p>
though i&apos;d add that this doesn&apos;t mean that i never procrastinate.
sure, i do that when at work and i&apos;m unsure what to do.
however i don&apos;t procrastinate in the mornings,
and that&apos;s the important point here.
</p>

<p>
effect
</p>

<p>
when i add together all the things i mentioned above, they do magic for me.
i think if i were to take to away any component, my system would fall apart.
but thanks to them, i feel quite good about my days,
i no longer feel that &quot;only if i&apos;d retire, could i really achieve my goals&quot;.
progress towards one&apos;s goals can be made anytime with the right habits.
one just need to find them with lots of reflection.
</p>

<h2 id="tscriting">tscriting</h2>
<p>
earlier this year i had this crazy idea that i wanted to learn german.
i looked around and found smartergerman.com
which would allow you to learn german online alone.
it was quite fine for a while
but i think having access to a private teacher is much better.
so i eventually stopped using the site in favor of the teacher,
well, at least as long as my job was reimbursing the lessons.
</p>

<p>
anyways, as i was lurking on a site I&apos;ve seen
that its owner was looking for someone to replicate a tool he has seen online.
this tool basically plays you a video,
and then you have to enter what you heard.
you can keep replaying the audio/video until you got your sentence right.
you can also ask for some hints too.
the guy tried to contact the owners of the tool he found,
but they weren&apos;t responsive at all, hence he looked someone to replicate it.
he wanted to play around with such a tool
and if people like it, he might even add it to his site.
i thought that would be a fun tool to work on.
</p>

<p>
so i volunteered that i can give a stab at it.
he even wanted to pay but i refused since i didn&apos;t want to deal with the taxes.
besides, what i had in mind was quite trivial,
i wouldn&apos;t really ask money for this.
</p>

<p>
for this project i came up with the name &quot;tscriter&quot;.
i meant it as a play on the phrase &quot;transcription tester&quot;.
i created a github project for it and started implementing it.
then we iterated for a while.
i implemented some features, and then he gave me feedback.
working like this was quite nice.
i even added some css after all the prompting.
i think it&apos;s more motivating if you are creating something for someone
rather than when you are creating something for yourself.
</p>

<p>
however as time went on and he played with my tool,
he realized that he wanted to have something different.
he wanted the tool to allow entering the full text,
and then count the mistakes like in a real dictation.
i thought this is also interesting but it should be a separate tool
rather than changing what i was working on at the moment.
i think someone else also volunteered to him
and that someone else did the dictation tool for him
so we sort of lost touch after this.
but he did upload my tool and asked their users to test it.
the results were mixed: some people liked it, some people not.
after seeing that, i guess he didn&apos;t go forward with adding my tool to his site.
</p>

<p>
you can check out the tool at /tscriter.
we were testing it with this smartergerman text: /tscriter#smartergerman.txt
</p>

<p>
i can no longer see any reference to this tool on his site
so i thought i&apos;ll delete the project from github
and put it on my blog to let it rest in peace.
</p>

<p>
before i stopped working on the project, i&apos;ve added a few more features.
all he wanted is just audio playback + a text entry box.
but eventually i figured out i can easily play back youtube videos,
and i can easily fetch the youtube subtitles too.
so i added a feature where you point the tool at a youtube video,
it extracts the subtitles and let&apos;s you type that.
</p>

<p>
however the problem is that there are very few videos
with good quality subtitles.
and with google deprecating apis all the time,
i&apos;d expect it won&apos;t work for long anyways.
so i still retain the capability to define custom text.
one can either host the texts or just paste them directly into the tool.
</p>

<p>
overall, it think it was a nice little project, i learned a lot.
totally would do it again!
try it out and let me know what you think about it!
</p>

<h2 id="kbd">kbd</h2>
<p>
for a very long time i was using a very standard us keyboard with a us layout.
it was a das keyboard with the cherry mx brown switches.
i bought it about 10 years ago and it still works perfectly.
i average about 80 wpm on it.
i got the blank keycap version so that i forced myself to not look at the keys.
i never learned proper typewriting,
so my typing style was whatever that evolved from only using hunt and peck.
</p>

<p>
but one thing was bugging me:
the qwerty layout wasn&apos;t designed with efficiency or ergonomics in mind.
the staggered rows was annoying me most --
i was really inaccurate for the non-main row keys.
so about 8 years ago i learned about ergodox
and thought maybe i should try switching to that.
the design of that had at least some thought in it.
and if i switch i might as well ditch the qwerty layout
for something that also had some effort in it.
but i never made the switch.
i think one of the big reasons was price.
it&apos;s quite expensive and i would need two: one for work, one for home.
but now that most of the tech world switched to wfh,
my excuse sort of evaporated, and i could no longer resist the temptation.
i got one from ergodox-ez since i didn&apos;t want to build my own.
</p>

<p>
then i had to pick a new keyboard layout too.
there were many to choose from: dvorak, colemak, workman, norman, etc.
i went with the norman one since that seemed the newest one.
and has incorporated the lessons of the previous ones and improved on them.
</p>

<p>
so i got my ergodox and i installed norman on it.
the first few days were miserable.
i had less than 10 wpm with it.
every keypress needed several seconds of deliberation
since i didn&apos;t know where the keys were by instinct.
i didn&apos;t have any muscle memory.
it was frustrating to have my thoughts buffered up in my mind,
yet i couldn&apos;t express them, just very slowly.
that actually changed my thinking a little bit temporarily:
i thought and coded in a way that required less typing from me.
i don&apos;t remember how it was different though,
i didn&apos;t make notes about this.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about ergodox is that is super configurable.
it has an online configurator
where you can set up the keys to do whatever you want.
if that&apos;s not enough, then technically you could build your own firmware,
but i never reached that point.
i played a lot with the settings and the key placements.
first, i put space on those big thumb keys,
but then later i realized it&apos;s better if it&apos;s on a closer key.
i also moved the ; key away from it&apos;s default position in norman.
i use that key surprisingly often in the vim and tmux context,
often with a modifier (in tmux) so i thought it&apos;s better on a big fat key.
</p>

<p>
i also experimented with its autoshift feature.
the idea is that if you hold down a key long enough (175 ms by default)
then you get the shifted version.
the downside is that you can&apos;t keep a key held down for an autorepeat.
though this can be worked around by disabling autoshift in other layers.
i tried using this for a while.
i only enabled it for the number row and the symbols.
i liked the idea i could type anything without the shift.
but i never managed to get the timing right so i made a lot of typos
and later i felt it was slowing me down, so i eventually disabled this feature.
</p>

<p>
but the idea of the autoshift still intrigues me somewhat.
i wish there were tactile switches with two levels.
if you pressed down harder, then the other switch would activate.
so a light press would trigger &apos;4&apos;, a hard press would trigger &apos;$&apos;.
it&apos;s a bit tricky but i think it&apos;s not impossible to implement this.
on the other hand it might be a be bad idea.
one would need to watch their pressure this way too
and thus it might end up just a net drag over the long term.
but still, it&apos;s an interesting idea.
</p>

<p>
anyways, for reference, here&apos;s my current layout:
https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/QXjem.
i&apos;ll keep this up do date as i further change my layout.
</p>

<p>
i started using a few online tools to track my wpm.
every morning i measured my speed and looked at the improvement rate.
i even used sites like keybr.com to improve my improvement rate.
my improvement rate was about 10 wpm per week for the first 4 weeks.
so i could reach about 50 wpm on a good day after a month.
the progress since then is much slower.
i&apos;m still at around 60 wpm currently.
</p>

<p>
huge gains in wpm wasn&apos;t even my primary goal.
i think at the 70-80 range, the typing speed stops mattering,
since i can&apos;t think fast enough to go at it other than for short bursts.
however my goal was to improve my accuracy.
i had a feeling that i&apos;m a bit inaccurate on qwerty,
and i suspected it was because the illogical staggered layout.
but i&apos;m quite inaccurate on my ergodox too.
well, it&apos;s partly because of the new layout,
but even as i got familiar with it, i still make a lot of mistakes,
and then i have to retype a lot.
this is actually what currently tanks my wpm.
</p>

<p>
i was hoping the online tools could improve this.
but all of them are super forgiving when it comes to typos.
they let you go back and fix your mistakes.
what i really wanted is something that really drills correct writing.
i haven&apos;t found one so i started thinking of making my own tool.
i wanted an interface that shows me one specific text,
and keeps me practicing on that singular text until i master it.
this reminded me of the trackmania game from nadeo.
it&apos;s a car racing game where you get an elaborate track,
and you have race through it in as little time as possible.
you then get a bronze/silver/gold medal based on your performance.
it can even show you your replay in the form of a ghost car.
i wanted to have something like this just for typing.
i tried searching for &quot;typemania&quot;.
it had a lot of results but nothing useful.
so i decided to make my own html5 game and called it peckmania
in order to bypass all the bad results
in case someone else is looking for this too.
</p>

<p>
the resulting game is at /peckmania.
</p>

<p>
although trackmania lets you make mistakes and has checkpoints
i didn&apos;t add support for backspacing to delete the last character/word.
i guess i could make something like that, but i didn&apos;t bother.
i want to be able to learn to type long sentences without mistakes,
so i want to make the game as punishing as possible.
otherwise i won&apos;t learn to slow down to my still accurate writing speed.
if i can master this, i could then write even with closed eyes!
</p>

<p>
i also liked the medal and the ghostcar features in trackmania,
so i implemented ranking and typeline.
the biggest rank is for 100 wpm.
nobody needs to be faster than that anyways.
for reference 100 wpm is about 8.3 characters per second.
it&apos;s quite insane and some people can do even 150 wpm with ease.
the typeline is a visualization of a typing run:
it displays which key was pressed at which time on a horizontal timeline.
you could technically see which sections or combinations were fast or slow.
</p>

<p>
initially i wasn&apos;t sure how will i implement the typeline.
i was thinking of a fancy graphical rendering logic using the html5 canvas.
but one needs to be very careful to make that look good on all resolutions.
after a lot of thinking on how to make it all look nice,
i decided i should just stick to black and white text.
that&apos;s super simple to deal with.
implementing fancy graphics can take ages and i&apos;d never finish then.
but sticking to a barebones ui allowed me
to actually finish all the important features,
even if they are all presented in a somewhat non-traditional interface.
but at least i completed something.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m glad i stuck to black and white text
because i can now easily use the whole thing on a monochrome monitor.
yes, i&apos;m using a special monochrome eink monitor right now
and i have lot of pent up sadness about the state of accessibility on the web,
but let me save those for a later post.

<p>
when i started on peckmania,
i still had two keyboards connected to my primary machine,
hence i added support for &quot;save slots&quot;.
so if anybody else is in a similar situation, they can switch between the slots
to track their progress on the different keyboards or layouts separately.
</p>

<p>
i also wanted to make it easy to experiment with different texts,
so i made it easy to import a completely custom level set.
i even included a few default ones like german, hungarian, programming.
but one can just simply change the text after the hash in the url bar
and can train on any text they can enter there.
</p>

<p>
peckmania saves all the results locally.
just like how in old games it was easy to move savedata around,
i wanted to have a similar usability feature here too.
in the old days the games put things into files
but that is a bit hard in the age of the browsers.
i realized that one could just simply use the clipboard for this.
so i just added event listeners for the clipboard events
and manipulated those for the export/import features.
i think it&apos;s quite neat,
maybe this sort of pattern should be more common in the world.
i ensured that all the data is simple text,
so it&apos;s very easy for the users to move it around,
or even track it in a version control system if they wished so.
if they do that they could even build some custom stats over time.
</p>

<p>
anyways, my point is that i think i added all the important features i wished
and now i can pretty much consider this little game as done.
all i need to do now is to practice with it
and see if my accuracy improves over time or now.
we&apos;ll see.
</p>

<p>
anyways, back to ergodox.
initially i experienced some slight discomfort in my thumbs.
that lasted quite a few weeks as i was using it.
but now that i got used to the keyboard, it&apos;s not really there anymore.
i think moving the spaces to closer keys helped.
that thumb block is really not for such a common key like space.
i also feel that on a standard keyboard some keys are easier to reach.
the middle fat keys still feel a bit unnatural to press.
but maybe with time this will also improve.
otherwise, now that i&apos;m getting used to it, i start liking my ergodox.
i wouldn&apos;t really recommend it for average users,
but if you spend all your day in front of a computer in a static corner,
i think it might worth a try.
but don&apos;t be discouraged with the few weeks of reduced productivity
until you reach back the same throughput as with an ordinary keyboard.
just keep practicing with it.
</p>

<p>
as for the norman layout:
i think it&apos;s a good layout once i got the hang of it.
more stuff on the main row makes it easier to type english text for me.
and i didn&apos;t lose all my qwerty skills either.
after a few minutes of qwerty typing my brain switches back into qwerty mode
and i can type the same as before, maybe with a bit higher typo rate.
i don&apos;t do qwerty on the ergodox though.
i think having two completely different keyboard helps with this switching.
but one needs to regularly practice the switching
otherwise one is likely to forget about the other layout.
</p>

<p>
however i still have a lot of trouble when it comes to writing symbols.
i guess that&apos;s partly because i didn&apos;t practice those as much as english.
but hopefully with time i&apos;ll catch up on those too.
</p>

<p>
i also didn&apos;t remap any vim, tmux or i3 keys.
navigating in those became a bit painful
but i sort of got the hang of it eventually.
</p>

<p>
in summary: currently i&apos;m experiencing lower speed and higher typo rate,
but at least my curiosity is sated, doesn&apos;t bug me anymore.
so overall i&apos;m glad i tried the switch
and looks like i&apos;ll be using my norman ergodox for a while
to see if i can get back to a similar performance long term.
but this is just my stockholm syndrome speaking so take it with a grain of salt.
</p>

<p>
edit: i keep some progress data at /kbdlog.

i&apos;m quite the sucker for temptations and vices.
i&apos;ve managed to avoid the worst ones
and fortunately no vice takes up too much time from me on average.
but sometimes i have a flareup and then i tend to go overboard with things.
i decide to check out a manga, an anime or a game,
and then i&apos;m spending 10 hours per day consuming it up to several weeks.
i guess i have issues with moderation.
during those flareups this can really affect my general productivity.
in the past i had all sorts of addictions
but i managed to cure myself out of them.
i do that by avoiding the triggers and resisting the temptations.
but sometimes it takes quite a long time for me to enact countermeasures.
here&apos;s a random sampling of addictions i have or had in the past:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much time on reddit or hackernews,
</li><li>
  too much time gaming,
</li><li>
  eating too much junk food,
</li><li>
  reading too many blogs,
</li><li>
  watching too much youtube, anime, or movies,
</li><li>
  obsessively checking my email,
</li><li>
  fapping too much.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in moderation they are fine,
but when i go overboard, i often regret all the wasted time and energy.
i regret not spending the time on stuff i know i wouldn&apos;t regret.
here&apos;s a sampling of stuff after which i feel somewhat good:
</p>

<ul><li>
  finishing some work related tasks,
</li><li>
  writing a blog post, demo, game,
</li><li>
  exchanging emails with people,
</li><li>
  spending time with people i like.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if i have a flareup of one of the former activities,
these preferred activities get much less attention,
which means i don&apos;t feel very good about myself.
all of these good things require a lot of energy to start them,
and if the activation energy is too high,
i&apos;m more tempted to procrastinate with the former activities.
</p>

<p>
i was thinking what options i have to help myself.
one common tip against bad habits is to replace them with different habits.
that sort of works but it&apos;s quite hard.
and it doesn&apos;t really help with the flareups,
where you spend a lot of time in a short burst on an activity.
i want something that would force me to moderate myself
and works regardless of activity.
</p>

<p>
my sudden idea is to assign an &quot;energy cost&quot; for those regretful activities.
i then have a limited supply of energy and i have to budget it thoughtfully.
if i have a lot of energy saved, i can let myself have some fun.
if i&apos;m low on energy, i can only allow the simplest things like checking email.
this still allows me to do things in bursts (that&apos;s my preference),
but thanks to the tracking
i can now rely on the system that it will prevent me from going overboard.
</p>

<p>
what should be the source of this energy?
well, these days i spend all my days indoors thanks to the covid19 lockdowns.
i just sit all day long.
i don&apos;t get any exercise at all.
therefore i decided to gain energy from doing some simple exercises.
the goal isn&apos;t to get buffed from these exercises,
but to have less zero days.
zero day means a day where you didn&apos;t do anything useful.
the goal is to avoid them.
so i guess this little gamification could help me avoid them.
</p>

<p>
i started this system when i was writing this post,
and i felt that it already helped me to curb my email checking addiction.
i don&apos;t want to waste my hard earned energy points on this silly habit.
there&apos;s no need to check it more than a few times a day.
this allows me to focus better
and makes it actually possible to write this post.
one could say that i&apos;m actually quantifying my opportunity cost
and i&apos;m using my loss aversion tendency to battle the bad habits.
</p>

<p>
to make things harder, i track energy in multiple dimensions.
each exercise type i track gets its own dimension.
for example i can start with three dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  pushup: 1 pushup = 1 pushup energy
</li><li>
  pullup: 1 pullup = 2 pullup energy
</li><li>
  squat: 2 squats = 1 squat energy
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in this example different exercises convert to different amount of energy.
pullups are hard for me, so i&apos;d get more energy from a single pushup.
squats are relatively easy, so i&apos;d need to do more from it for a single point.
</p>

<p>
to use up some energy, i subtract that energy from all dimensions!
for example if i have pushup:7 pullup:6 squat:3 energy levels,
and checking on email costs 2 energy points,
then after that i&apos;d have pushup:5 pullup:4 squat:1 energy remaining.
i&apos;d need to do 2 squats again before i could check on my email again.
i subtract from all dimensions to ensure my exercises are somewhat balanced.
the goal of the system is to stay in the positive range
and rack up enough buffer
so that i can enjoy some of the bad activities when i feel down.
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s super easy to add and remove exercise dimensions as i see fit.
maybe i get some dumbbells and then i can add a dumbbell curls.
maybe some day i want to focus on being more outside.
then i can add an outside dimension
which will result in 2 energy points for every minute spent outside.
or if pushups become to easy,
i can just change my accounting so that i need 2 pushups for each energy point.
or maybe i break a leg bone, then i can remove tracking squat for a while.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about using exercises is
that after an exercise i feel more motivated to do sensible stuff.
exercise somehow wakes up my spirit.
so this system not only limits my bad habits,
but it also motivates me to spend time on my preferred activities.
and getting some exercise out of it is not a bad deal either.
i tried going to gym a while ago.
i&apos;ve lasted a couple months but i found it incredibly boring.
i felt that there was just no point to it.
but this system gives me some goal for the exercises.
i understand that these little exercises don&apos;t substitute real exercise.
however i&apos;m more likely to do it several times per day
which is good from a &quot;take a break from the computer&quot; perspective at least.
by the way, this style of training is called &quot;grease the groove&quot;,
although i&apos;m not taking this experiment seriously enough to call it a training.
</p>

<p>
i also have a lot of flexibility over costs too.
for example i can start with this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1 point for each minute of youtube, anime, tv watched or game played,
</li><li>
  2 points for checking on email,
</li><li>
  10 points for checking on memes or aggregators,
</li><li>
  10 points for eating some junk food.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the costs are arbitrary
and subject to constant tweaking based on how i feel about my habits.
in order for me to binge watch a long anime,
i have to buffer up a lot of energy.
which is good, because at least my body got something out of it.
and since i couldn&apos;t watch said anime until i buffered up enough energy,
i probably spent a lot of time on doing nice stuff in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t plan to use this as an excuse to restart my old bad habits.
i&apos;d still heavily avoid hackernews for example.
one visit to that site and my day is ruined.
it&apos;s more for protection against accidental visits or accidental new habits.
if i notice i started doing something that i regret afterwards,
i can quickly assign some cost to it and thus limit myself.
</p>

<p>
i also put an upper limit of 1000 points on the values in the dimensions.
for example that&apos;s about 16.5 hours of anime watching.
this way i can be certain
that i won&apos;t burn more than 2 days in a row just on a single anime.
the other function of the upper limit,
is to signal that an exercise is maybe too easy.
if i can easily reach 1000 in a dimension, maybe i should make it harder.
e.g. if i could easily make 1000 pushups in a few days (i wish),
i could change the accounting to have 2 pushups only mean 1 point.
or maybe i could pushups with a weighted vest.
</p>

<p>
although the system allows the energy levels to go below 0,
but i wouldn&apos;t allow that to happen (hopefully).
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s relatively easy to track this on pen and paper.
all you need is a table.
each row should have a timestamp (mmdd hhmm format to save space),
and the latest energy levels for each dimension.
suppose it&apos;s july 17 and you start with 10 energy points in each dimension,
check on the email, then do another 2 pushups, then watch a cat video next day.
your table would look like this:
</p>

<pre>
  timestamp | pushup | pullup | squat | comment
  ----------+--------+--------+-------+--------
  0717 0800 |     10 |     10 |    10 |
       0817 |      8 |      8 |     8 | email
       0820 |     10 |        |       |
  0718 0703 |      6 |      4 |     4 | 4min cat video
</pre>

<p>
the comment column is optional, i think i would leave it empty most of the time.
and if the level is the same as in the previous row, i can leave that empty too.
timestamp is also optional to track.
if you do it, you can then graph your energy levels over time.
even if you do that, tracking hour and minute might be overkill,
maybe just note the day and track only that.
</p>

<p>
in my case i spend almost all my time in front of the computer,
so obviously i made a script for myself to do this tracking.
i made a little &quot;enacc&quot; tool and it logs all my changes into the ~/.enacc file.
enacc stands for energy accounting tool.
i can write &quot;enacc 2&quot; and it subtracts 2 from all dimensions.
then it prints the current stats.
i can write &quot;enacc pushup 10&quot; and it logs that i gained 10 pushup points.
i can just write &quot;enacc&quot; and it displays usage and the comments from ~/.enacc.
i keep my current dimensions and costs in the comments in that file,
so this way i can easily remind myself of my commitments.
here&apos;s an example run:
</p>

<pre>
  $ enacc
  enacc - energy accounter.
  usage 1: enacc [dim val]...
  usage 2: enacc [val]
  dim is either &apos;sub&apos; or one of the energy dimensions.
  dim &apos;sub&apos; subtracts val from each energy dimension.
  otherwise val is added to the specific dimension.
  val on its own is the same as &apos;sub val&apos;.
  ~/.enacc file comments and energy levels:
  # dimensions:
  # - push: 1 ordinary pushup.
  # - pull: 1 inverted row with the help of a desk.
  # - jump: 2 jumping jumps for each energy point.
  # costs:
  # - checking email or running the todo script: 2
  # - for each minute of video entertainment: 1
  # - for each minute of gaming: 1
  # - checking on memes or aggregators: 10
  # - eating junk food: 10
  # - fapping: 20
  push:24 pull:14 jump:14
</pre>

<p>
that output was generated from this file:
</p>

<pre>
  $ cat ~/.enacc
  # dimensions:
  # - push: 1 ordinary pushup.
  # - pull: 1 inverted pushup with the help of a desk.
  # - jump: 2 jumping jumps for each energy point.
  # costs:
  # - checking email or running the todo script: 2
  # - for each minute of video entertainment: 1
  # - for each minute of gaming: 1
  # - checking on memes or aggregators: 10
  # - eating junk food: 10
  # - fapping: 20

<p>
i track a full timestamp here because for computers that&apos;s not a problem.
i keep this script in my utilities repo here:
https://github.com/ypsu/cfg/blob/master/utils/enacc.c
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s a linux commandline utility though.
there are probably gazillion more mature apps doing the same.
maybe they can make the tracking even simpler.
i don&apos;t know, i haven&apos;t researched this area online,
i might have missed some nice improvements.
i came up with this on my own
after being frustrated with watching too much anime recently.
maybe try the paper tracking first
before investing too much time in a complicated tool though.
</p>

<p>
i also don&apos;t track on what i wasted my energy points on.
it would just add more toil tracking this and i&apos;d be more likely to give up.
i want the process to be as easy as possible, so i only care about the numbers.
to be fair, i wouldn&apos;t even care about using a log format in my tool,
and just have like 3 numbers in a text file representing the actual levels.
the only reason i use the log format because then i can easily append to it.
i don&apos;t like rewriting files because it&apos;s brittle from coding perspective.
but appending to files is usually a very safe and easy operation to implement.
just think about tracking this on paper:
appending is the only sensible way to do it.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t actually know if i&apos;ll be able to commit myself to this system long term.
but uncertainty should stop me from trying random stuff.
it&apos;s definitely worth a try and see how it goes.
