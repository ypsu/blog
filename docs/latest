<p>
if you are reading the html version of this on a desktop,
then open the developer console (key f12, usually) and enter this:
</p>

<pre>
  document.head.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;style&gt;p{white-space:pre-wrap;}&lt;/style&gt;&quot;;
</pre>

<p>
this will make this post look use the semantic linebreaks too.
</p>

<p>
semantic linebreaks is an old idea where you put a newline after a thought ends.
basically a newline after the periods or thought joining commas.
previously i used to format my plaintext to 80 characters.
i never really liked the &quot;write a paragraph per line&quot; style of editing.
now i think semantic linebreaks are superior to 80 character wrapping.
first, it has many technological advantages.
you don&apos;t have to reformat your lines after each edit.
that takes out a lot of churn out of this old style text editing.
making edits with a line oriented editor like vim also gets easier.
it&apos;s super easy to shuffle text around, or just rewrite small parts.
such edits look much simpler in text diffing tools too.
</p>

<p>
then there&apos;s the other, emotional aspect of it.
now keep in mind, that i still limit myself to 80 characters per line.
with sembreaks this means that all my thoughts must fit 80 characters.
i still permit separate clauses to spill onto separate lines though.
i used this style for a few weeks now in personal writing.
it does feel that it makes my sentencer simpler, perhaps more childish.
but i feel more clarity out of them.
this way i must find the beginning and the end of each thought.
each thought must be short and must stand on its own.
i can&apos;t drone on and on without saying anything.
i feel that this creative limitation helps me to think.
it forces me to break down those swirling thoughts into digestible pieces.
</p>

<p>
i think, though not sure how to show, but this makes reading easier too.
think of the process of programming.
we also put all the statements onto their own, separate lines.
it would look weird if you would format code to 80 characters.
it just feels cleaner when done this way.
so why wouldn&apos;t we want this extra clarity from ordinary text too?
</p>

<p>
this method does make text use up more vertical space.
in some cases this can be a disadvantage.
perhaps in the ancient times the paper was expensive.
or people don&apos;t like overly thick books.
but on computer screen i think the extra height is not an issue.
</p>

<p>
i tried to convert ordinary text into sembreak&apos;d style with this script:
</p>

<pre>
  document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/[:;.?!,] /g, &apos;$&amp;&lt;br&gt;&apos;)
</pre>

<p>
it didn&apos;t work.
if something wasn&apos;t written with the 80 character / thought limit,
then sembreaks won&apos;t make it easier to read.
</p>

<p>
it also initally makes the text to look like poetry.
it adds some rythm to the text and it feels a little bit weird to read.
search for &quot;ventilated prose&quot; and see the discussion around this.
with that search term you&apos;ll see so other examples of this style.
but i see that a lot of examples are splitting mid-thought.
they use super narrow margins.
they never really recommend a specific character limit.
they let people go with their gut feelings of what is long.
i don&apos;t really like this approach, i prefer static limits.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s also a lot of discussion about how manual wrapping is 70-ies tech.
that this day and age we should just write full paragraphs per line.
i don&apos;t really have a good argument against this.
if people don&apos;t mind relying on fancy text editors for text editing,
then they should go for it.
i&apos;m old school, and i like relying on less tech to do simple things.
hence i wrap manually and now semantically.
besides, if you write markdown or html, the renderers will reformat anyways.
</p>

<p>
i started writing my personal emails with this style.
my emails are always plaintext.
looks like nobody was bothered enough to complain about this style.
maybe people don&apos;t mind reading text like this.
i&apos;m now trying to write my work emails like this too and see how it goes.
maybe the idea catches on eventually.
maybe someone else will start communicating with me with this style.
then, hopefully, i&apos;ll be able to tell if it really makes things nicer or not.
for now i&apos;ll just keep the solo experiment going.
</p>

<h2 id="touch">touch</h2>
<p>
i&apos;m quite a reserved person. it&apos;s quite hard for me to verbally express my
wishes. i often don&apos;t even know what i want. and when i do, then i worry that if
i express it to the other person, they will get offended about me and it just
ruins the relationship. i&apos;m always on the lookout for things that make human
interactions a little bit easier.
</p>

<p>
i like receiving and giving touch quite much. but people have very diverse
preferences about what is an okay touch and what is not. so i tend to err on the
conservative side and just keep to myself. otherwise i&apos;d need to communicate
with people. fortunately i found a very nice but very simple game that can free
up people from all the worries when it comes to touch. and you can play this
with any willing person. it&apos;s called the &quot;3 minute game&quot; and was popularized by
betty martin.
</p>

<p>
first, let&apos;s talk about some aspects of the &quot;wheel of consent&quot;, or a simplified
version of it. each act a human does can be categorized into one of the
following 4 dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  giving: i&apos;m doing something to someone for their benefit
</li><li>
  receiving: someone does something to me for my own benefit
</li><li>
  taking: i&apos;m doing something to someone for my own benefit
</li><li>
  allowing: someone does something to me for their benefit
</li>
</ul>

<p>
they complement each other. when person a is giving to b, then b is receiving.
if person a is taking from b, person b is allowing. you can draw this in a fancy
circle, that&apos;s where the name &quot;wheel of consent&quot; comes from.
</p>

<p>
how much giving, receiving, taking, allowing a person does, matters. each person
has a healthy limit for each dimension. going over we get to the &quot;shadow sides&quot;
of the dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much giving: martyr, self sacrificer
</li><li>
  too much receiving: freeloader, entitled
</li><li>
  too much taking: raper, stealer
</li><li>
  too much allowing: pushover, endurer
</li>
</ul>

<p>
you want to ensure that every act for everyone involved remains in the inner,
non-shadow side of the dimensions.
</p>

<p>
next up, you really need to understand which dimension each act is in for each
person involved. suppose you regularly do an activity (e.g. foot massage). you
think you are doing it as a favor for person b so you are in the giving
dimension. for the other person that activity is in the allowing dimension. they
let you do it because they think you like doing it. but giving and allowing are
not complementary dimensions. it turns out nobody really wants that activity yet
none of the people involved realize this. this is basically a variant of the
abilene paradox. there&apos;s also the flipside to this: you often don&apos;t do some acts
because you think the other person wouldn&apos;t like it. however it might be the
case they would allow you to experiment with it. but you don&apos;t even ask because
of the fear of rejection.
</p>

<p>
the &quot;3 minute game&quot; is a short game that helps you structure communication along
those 4 dimensions. it helps you do activities where it is super clear who it is
for. it consists of four 3 minute rounds. in round 1 player a asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like me to touch you for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person a will be doing something to person b for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective the activity is giving, from
person b&apos;s perspective it is a receiving activity. keep in mind that person a
shouldn&apos;t sink to the shadow sides of their dimension, they should only do what
they are comfortable to give to the other person. in other words they have to
consent to the act. if person a is not happy with the arrangement, they might
negotiate a little bit what their limits are and then agree on that. on the
flipside person b might just want a boring neck massage. it doesn&apos;t have to
sexual all the time. person a has to accept that in this round it&apos;s all about
person b&apos;s wishes. once everybody is happy agreed on the activity, person a does
the agreed on touch for 3 minutes. then person b thanks for person a for this.
</p>

<p>
in round 2, player a again asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like to touch me for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person b will be doing something to person a for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective this is allowing, while from
person b&apos;s perspective this is taking. the same negotiation and consent process
happens just as before. person b might be very horny and might want to crazy
stuff. person a must realize that this is fine to express and that they don&apos;t
have to succumb to the shadow side, they can refuse and person b shall respect
that otherwise they are succumbing to the shadow side. once agreed, person b
does the activity for 3 minutes. again, since this was for person b&apos;s benefit,
person b thanks person a for the act.
</p>

<p>
round 3 and 4 is the same as round 1 and 2 but with the other person asking the
questions. the whole thing takes about 15 minutes and is worth every minute of
it.
</p>

<p>
this game might sound a little bit silly at first. but what makes it truly
remarkable is that it makes you stop for a minute and think. the question might
initially look simple enough but answering them often is quite hard. it&apos;s very
rare that we get a question on what we want. often i don&apos;t even know what sort
of touch i really want but this lets me think deep on what sort of thing would
fill me up now the best. and i can be very selfish in these thoughts, i don&apos;t
need to play an internal chess to ensure whatever i want is something compatible
with my partner. or that if i ask for this particular thing then my relationship
would spoil a bit. the flipside is true too: my partner can think of anything.
even if i don&apos;t really like the requested activity, i&apos;m certainly willing to
give it 3 minutes, whatever it is. it can be a really freeing sensation once you
experience this game in a safe and supportive environment. you feel like you can
ask for anything and not be judged. you can say anything you want. i haven&apos;t
really tried it in a non-sexual environment so i don&apos;t know how well it works
there but i&apos;d suspect it should hold up quite well there as well. you can see
sample sessions from such environment in betty&apos;s original videos and you can
see the participants happy with the game. betty&apos;s videos are well worth a watch.
</p>

<p>
in the original documentation of this game, betty mentions that this is a game
for 2 or more people. the &quot;or more&quot; version is quite intriguing to me. she
didn&apos;t really explain that part as far as i remember. i&apos;m not entirely sure how
that would work. e.g. how could 3 people play this game? i think what you can do
is that rather than a single person asking the questions, 2 people ask the
questions together to the 3rd person. the third person then can come up with
activities that involve the first two people doing something to the third and
only proceed with the act if everyone agrees to it without succumbing to the
shadow sides. i guess that&apos;s how the &quot;or more&quot; works: each round a selected
person has to ask the group for something they can do together for the selected
person&apos;s benefit. it probably scales okay to 4 people but afterwards i&apos;d imagine
it has way too much communication overhead. never tried this though so not sure
how transformative experience the group setting is yet.
</p>

<p>
the wheel of consent itself is a quite generic concept. it can apply in other
cases as well, not just the above game. e.g. you get invited to a party. do you
go or not? who benefits from you going to the party? it is an interesting
viewpoint to see our activities from. and things can get complicated: you only
benefit from the party if some other person also goes. and that other person
only benefits if you go. now you have these complex, conditional scenarios that
i can&apos;t really wrap my head around yet, so i&apos;ll not dig into this aspect. i&apos;m
just trying to popularize this wheel of consent concept because looks like it&apos;s
a useful framework to work with.
</p>

<p>
if you ever try this game then let me know how it went and what your experiences
with it were.
</p>

<h2 id="talking">talking</h2>
<p>
suppose you have a friend or three. i like to imagine such hypothetical
scenarios. and further imagine that you throw or are invited to a small party
with them. what do you really do there? i don&apos;t really like music, dancing,
drinking and such. i&apos;m more of a sit in the quiet corner and listen to other
people sort of person. maybe play some game. but what game?
</p>

<p>
ideally it will be a game that isn&apos;t too complex and doesn&apos;t really require too
many props. i very quickly lose interest in games with many rules. and even if
you can follow them all, what&apos;s the point in playing such a game? i feel it&apos;s
just killing time. if i am already with people, i&apos;d want a game that focuses on
the people instead. it should make it possible for me to learn more about others
to see what people they really are. so basically i just want some structured
talking instead and the &quot;game&quot; could provide the structure.
</p>

<p>
one popular simple party game is cards against humanity. there is a list of
cards with questions on it, face down. each turn a player (called the czar)
turns a question card up and people have to come up with a witty answer to it.
each player has 10 cards with pre-written answer cards from which they can
choose from. or one could play this even without pre-written answers and rely on
people&apos;s inner creativity to come up with witty answers. the person who turned
up the question card has to pick the wittiest response. the owner of that
response wins the round. the answer cards should be shuffled before the czar
evaluates to avoid biased selection. this would be harder in the handwritten,
artisan answers but one could solve that by writing the responses on a
smartphone.
</p>

<p>
this is quite a fun game, potentially leading to fun times. the downside is that
you don&apos;t learn much from the other people, only their wittiness. so i was
looking for other similar games with more focus on the people themselves. and i
found some! and the rules are even simpler. i found two games and they go with
the names of &quot;disturbing friends&quot; and &quot;voting game&quot; and sort of came up with my
own rules based on the ideas behind these games.
</p>

<p>
the first game has question cards which contain a question and 2 to 4 answers. a
player, the round&apos;s czar, turns up a question card. the other players have to
guess how the czar will answer the question. the czar must try to answer the
question as honestly as they can. often there are no correct answers. in such
case the czar must pick the answer closest to their heart. each player has some
voting cards each with a number from 1 to 4. every player has to pick their
answer and put the corresponding voting card in front of them, face down. once
each player has voted, people reveal their vote one by one and finally the czar
reveals their answer. the czar wins (or loses depending on perspective) the
round if half or more of people didn&apos;t guess the answer correctly.
</p>

<p>
depending on the questions this can be quite fun with unexpected twists. you can
have a neutral question like &quot;best pet: cat/dog/fish&quot; and learn what animal the
czar likes. the czar also learns what other people&apos;s impressions of him are. you
can have a more politically motivated question like &quot;gun ownership: yes to
all/only license/banned completely&quot; to learn how people think politically. or
you can have a question like &quot;polyamory: it&apos;s a bad idea/ok but not for me/i am
polyamorous&quot; to learn other people&apos;s inclinations. the nice thing here is that
the game brings up the question, you don&apos;t really have to awkwardly bring it up
yourself in case you are curious about people&apos;s opinions on a topic. or you can
have a dirty nsfw question like &quot;my crotch has (select first that apply):
jewelry/scar tissue/ tattoo/other surprise&quot;. this is where the unexpected twists
can occur: maybe some people get intrigued by the czar&apos;s answer and then the
czar flashes their body to the party. that certainly could result in a lot of
fun from then on!
</p>

<p>
the ideal number of people for this game is about 4 so that the czar can see the
opinion of 3 people which is not too little, nor too much. but i think a couple
or a pair of people could also play this game. in such case the goal remains to
guess the other person&apos;s answer and see how well the two people know each other
and learn more about each other.
</p>

<p>
the other game is a bit simpler because it doesn&apos;t have a czar. you don&apos;t have
questions here but rather statements. each person gets assigned a distinct
number from 1 to n before the game starts. each round the group turns up a
statement card. people then have to vote which person is best described by the
statement. the round is won (or lost depending on perspective) by the person
acquiring the most votes. if there is a tie, people can break that verbally by
arguing who should be the winner.
</p>

<p>
a neutral question could be something like &quot;... cooks the best&quot;. people can then
see whose cooking they find the best. a more interesting one could be &quot;... can
hold their breath the longest&quot;. people might contest the result of the vote and
a fun breath holding contest might start. a nsfw statement might be &quot;... wants
to hang around naked&quot;. people then could then ask the winner &quot;do you really want
to be naked&quot; and maybe the party pivots into a fun naked party!
</p>

<p>
this game is probably best played with 5 people so that there are less chances
for ties. but i think this one could be played by a couple too. the couple just
decides between each other who wins each statement.
</p>

<p>
in order to play this game, one needs voting cards. one solution is to take
postit notes and write some numbers on them. the other solution is to cut up an
a4 paper into small slips and write some number on them. or even less effort
would be to find some coins or other small items. when you want to vote for 3,
you put 3 coins into your hand under the table and then show your hand when your
time comes. one doesn&apos;t need elaborate equipment or boards to play these games.
</p>

<p>
there could be some punishment or reward for the losers and winners each round.
ideas:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the losers have to make 5 pushups or squats each time,
</li><li>
  the winners can consume something of their preference,
</li><li>
  they need to remove or acquire a piece of clothing,
</li><li>
  they choose the background music for the next round,
</li><li>
  others can draw funny stuff on their faces or body,
</li><li>
  they need to be standing for the next round.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it doesn&apos;t really matter much what it is but if there&apos;s some form of feedback
then that raises the stakes a bit and makes the game a bit more interesting. the
party members much agree on this beforehand so that everybody is comfortable
with the punishments.
</p>

<p>
one could print the question and statement cards but i don&apos;t think it&apos;s
necessary. as long as one has an app loaded with bunch of questions, one could
just use a smartphone to present the questions. ideally people should source
their own questions. nevertheless i decided to collect some sample questions and
statements and make a small tool for it that is convenient to use from a
smartphone. i even separated out the nsfw stuff so you can even play this in a
family friendly setting. but a warning: the nsfw stuff is quite strong, i
believe. only enable it with friends you absolutely trust no matter what happens
or people you don&apos;t know at all so that there are less stakes in the manner. if
in doubt, just look up the list of questions in the source of the webpage before
playing the game. the webpage has no dependencies so feel free to copy it
somewhere and edit the list of questions in it, e.g. remove the potentially
offending ones and add your topics of interest. you can find my tool here:
</p>

<ul><li>
  https://notech.ie/cards
</li>
</ul>

<p>
load that on a smartphone, select your list and put it into the middle of the
table and keep pressing next as the rounds progress. it has about 30 cards for
each type. if you ever try it then let me know how it went. i never tried this
so caveat emptor. maybe i&apos;ll have the chance to try this one day (with the nsfw
stuff included) and then i can improve it or list more tips here.
</p>

<h2 id="shooter">shooter</h2>
<p>
this is another of those fantasy posts where i think aloud what sort of game i
would try to make if i had infinite time, motivation and energy to do things. in
the past i sometimes did sit down and start working on a game but i always gave
up after the initial excitement evaporated. at this point, i&apos;m happy if i can
simply formulate what i would do. this way maybe my brain can give the obsessive
thoughts about the game a rest.
</p>

<p>
so usually when i think about making a game or software, i try to think only
about making the core work well and not care about making it fancy or good
looking. for me if the core is good, i don&apos;t need fancy graphics or user
interfaces. in fact, they would just get into the way. i&apos;d only need fancy
graphics if the core is just not good enough, and i&apos;d need some sort of eye
candy that sort of hides the fact that the underlying game is actually boring.
unfortunately most modern games are like that: they look very fancy but are
actually quite boring if you were to remove fancy graphics and replace it with
simple shapes (e.g. spheres). the question is: can you make a shooter that is
fun in itself even if it just consists of, say, spheres. e.g. each enemy and
each projectile, (hell, maybe even the walls) are just spheres?
</p>

<p>
one of the reasons i&apos;m actually not interested in making such a game, because
there is already one good free single player shooter game: brutal doom when
played on the original doom 2 maps. it runs on a relatively simple engine so it
can&apos;t do too fancy stuff. but what remains is basically superb. good feedback on
the enemies, good gun mechanics, good maps, no unskippable videos, no overlong
loading durations, no high computer requirements. it just gets everything pretty
much right. i couldn&apos;t find any other game coming near to the utility of this
doom 2 mod. actually, most modern games try to model things more and more
realistically which actually works against the fun of the game. if i wanted a
really realistic shooter, i&apos;d just go play paintball in real life. even though
we already have brutal doom, i wonder, can you go for a significantly simpler
game and still have it quite fun?
</p>

<p>
one of hard the problem of games is content. in case of shooters you need some
maps and some motivation and goal for shooting all the enemies. i really hate
the overly abstract games where you only play for scores. i&apos;m not very
competitive person, i want to enjoy the game alone, on its own, or if
multiplayer, then it should be some sort of cooperative game where you have to
play together to achieve a common goal rather than competing against each other.
competition is only fun while i&apos;m winning but if i&apos;m constantly on the losing
side, the game becomes quite boring for me. most of the time i don&apos;t want to
invest into the game enough to become competitive so i just stick to single
player games.
</p>

<p>
in this hypothetical game i would take the maps of doom 2. i like those maps
since structurally they are 2d maps yet they still contain rooms with various
heights so the fights have a vertical element. however good maps are not enough
alone. so i&apos;d also add some short story progression text between the level
transitions. i&apos;m not sure what sort of text but each transition text should have
the following properties:
</p>

<ul><li>
  it&apos;s short. about 5-10 lines of text (assuming 80 character lines).
</li><li>
  explains what the player achieved or learned in the previous area story-wise.
</li><li>
  shows a simple overview of the next area and their objectives (e.g. where the
  keys and corresponding doors are).
</li><li>
  explains why the player is entering the next area story-wise.
</li><li>
  mentions some hints about the map secrets so the player has something to look
  out for.
</li><li>
  progresses the main storyline in a suspense building way. the player should
  want to finish the next map just to see what happens.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if it&apos;s possible, a few comics would also work but that sounds way too much
effort. text is enough if one is going for simplicty.
</p>

<p>
on the technical side, i&apos;d just hardcode the game resolution to 640x360. if the
graphics and gameplay are quite simple, it doesn&apos;t need a lot of detail. then a
smaller scale is more than enough. smaller scale means that the game is more
performant, it will work on very weak machines too. having a fixed resolution
makes a lot of things very simple: i wouldn&apos;t need to deal with supporting all
sorts of aspect ratio issues, making sure my fonts and heads up display are
legible, and many other things like that. i picked that resolution specifically
because scaling it 2x will get me 720p, scaling it 3x will get me 1080p. i like
such exact scaling because then the game can remain pixel exact. i don&apos;t like
blurry things.
</p>

<p>
there would be only one weapon in the game. i think it&apos;s important to pick one
weapon and focus on making the gameplay fun with that. i understand that game
can be more compelling if it has a lot of variety but that is not my goal here.
what i&apos;m trying to see if you can make a shooter based on a single gun
compelling enough. but what weapon should i pick? most shooters have 4 common
weapons:
</p>

<ul><li>
  sniper gun
</li><li>
  tracer gun
</li><li>
  shotgun
</li><li>
  projectile gun
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the first option is the sniper rifle with an optional zoom: this is a hitscan
weapon for very long distance battles. this can be quite rewarding but at the
same time quite frustrating if you have bad aim. it&apos;s also quite boring in the
sense that you are usually quite motionless, the movement is not that important.
so this gun doesn&apos;t satisfy the fun in the movement dimension. there&apos;s also the
problem of dealing with lag in multiplayer games. getting the correctness right
is quite a hard problem. one doesn&apos;t want to experience the fact that they
correctly clicked on a target, yet the server refused to acknowledge the hit. so
if one wants multiplayer, sniper rifles can get quite tricky to implement
fairly.
</p>

<p>
by tracer guns i mean guns that are hitscan weapons with high fire rate. the
player needs to trace the enemy continuously - keep aiming at the enemy while
continuously attacking to slowly destroy the enemy&apos;s shields and health.
examples are the machine guns in most old shooters, the lighting gun in quake 1,
the link gun in unreal tournament, or most rapid or continuous fire guns. these
are usually mid range weapons. my problem with this sort of guns is that they
are not as satisfying as the other type of guns. with a sniper rifle or shotgun,
you can eliminate the enemies with one shot if you are lucky. that&apos;s satisfying
because you get an instant feedback for an action. with tracer guns the gameplay
feels like a grind. gears of war contains lot of action like this and i find
that boring. that game feels like a chore. so i&apos;d totally avoid building the
main gameplay around this.
</p>

<p>
i love the overpowered shotguns in some of the games. brutal doom has it pretty
good. what i love about them the most is that in close range you can instant
kill the enemy, and gibs of the enemy fly away. it&apos;s a very satisfying thing.
and this also requires good amount of movement skill too. you have to run back
and forth against the enemy for the attacks because the shotgun is ineffective
outside its range. this is quite fun but the problem i think i have is that most
of the satisfaction comes from the effect of the gun rather than the skill of
the player. it&apos;s not super hard to play with it. and if you go with pure
graphics, a lot of the gun feedback goes away and it won&apos;t be as enjoyable, at
least not for long.
</p>

<p>
by projectile guns i mean guns that shoot flying projectiles that travel at
moderate, constant speed. think of the rocket launcher of quake and unreal
tournament, or the shock rifle&apos;s alternative attack in unreal tournament. i also
assume that this gun is not fast firing, so there&apos;s some delay between the
shots. i never really liked these guns for two reasons: they were slow so there
was a lot of dead time during action, and more importantly it&apos;s usually super
hard to hit moving targets with them. but i have to admit: hitting someone with
such projectile is very satisfying. but still, in total: not fun. at least that
was my opinion until i played shootmania which i think did something genius.
</p>

<p>
before explaining that, let&apos;s talk about the concept of ammo a little bit. ammo
adds a tactical dimension to a game. the amount of ammo you have changes your
tactic. full ammo? go guns blazing. low on ammo? play it very carefully, try to
eliminate enemies one by one with precision attacks. it also paces the game a
little bit. it forces you to explore the map for the resources. so it prevents
the game from being all action. in modern games you even have reloading, which
forces you to take mini-breaks from the action which helps you take a breath and
perhaps rethink your strategy. it&apos;s also a nice ritual you do after each battle.
it also helps to add a closure to a battle since you probably won&apos;t reload
during a battle unless you absolutely must. you do it when you feel your job is
done. i believe there might be also another psychological aspect of being more
vulnerable during a reload which also satisfies some internal craving of being
defenseless in a safe environment but i haven&apos;t thought about this aspect a lot
so let&apos;s not get into this.
</p>

<p>
the problem i have with ammo is that they take away from the purity of the game.
it makes the players inequal. the person with more ammo is at an advantage. so
at this point the game is not pure shooting skill, but also map control tactics.
both shootmania and mass effect solved this very nicely while still retaining
some of the above mentioned benefits: just have infinite, slowly recharging
ammo. in shootmania you have a single gun: a gun that shoots projectiles. but it
has a catch compared to the above games: there&apos;s no splash damage, you have to
hit the other player to frag them. that in itself would make it super hard but
to counteract this problem, you can shoot the gun as fast as you can. so you can
spray your enemy with projectiles. but that in itself would make it like a
tracer gun so to counteract that, you have only 3 shots in the gun. but they
quickly recharge, so even if you shoot away all your charges simultaneously, few
seconds later you can shoot again. however if you shoot as soon as your first
charge is ready, you&apos;ll need to wait again for your next shot. so what happens
often in close battles is that you have two players dancing around each other,
waiting for the right time to start attacking. too soon - they will have less
charges available - less chance of hitting the enemy. if they wait too long, the
enemy might start spray attacking sooner giving them a high chance for defeating
the player. and there&apos;s no unnatural need to run away from a battle due to lack
of ammo. the only thing the player needs to concentrate on is the other player
and the timing. it&apos;s as pure skill as possible.
</p>

<p>
so that&apos;s one aspect of gameplay. the other aspect is that you have a projectile
gun which means it&apos;s incredibly satisfying when you hit the other person. with a
typical hitscan weapon you just need to move the cursor over the other person&apos;s
avatar and shoot. it&apos;s a very mechanical skill that requires very good reflexes.
with projectiles you don&apos;t need to do that. all you need to do is to predict
where the enemy will be in a few seconds in the future. the nice thing about
this is, that you can compensate for bad reflexes simply by increasing your
distance to the enemy and making better predictions. and it&apos;s not like your
predictions must be absolutely perfect. the projectile balls are quite sizeable
so you have quite reasonable margin of error. and since you can spray 3 shots in
a row, you can cover a larger area. or even shoot tactically - use the first
projectile to make the enemy go down a certain path where you&apos;ll greet them with
your second projectile.
</p>

<p>
to summarize: i think a fast shooting projectile gun with limited but recharging
ammunition is the best gun to make a pure skill based bare bones shooter.
</p>

<p>
alright, we got the weapon down. next up is health. in general i think the
concept of health is silly. especially recharging health. if you have the
concept of health, then you start worrying about health. that takes away from
the pure shooting skill. i think the best thing to do is just to have instant
death. if you hit the enemy, the enemy dies. if the enemy hits you, you die.
shootmania actually gives you 2-3 lives so the first shot doesn&apos;t kill you
except for certain gamemodes. i think that&apos;s fine too up to a point. but if i
have to be as pure as possible and choose one gamemode, i&apos;d go with one hit one
kill. my motivation here is to simply not allow place for mistakes. if you win a
level then you should win it without any mistakes. that way you will feel the
best about yourself, that&apos;s how it should maximise the feeling of achievement.
</p>

<p>
keep in mind that i&apos;d play this game on doom 2 maps. they are relatively quite
small and if you don&apos;t hunt for resources, you can pretty much run through them
quite fast. so you wouldn&apos;t need checkpoints or savegame support. the game would
be only about the fact whether you can run through the map without a mistake or
not. the main challenge would be about you avoiding the enemy attacks until you
either manage to run past them or eliminate them based on your preferences. you
make a mistake, you quickly start from beginning and you keep trying until you
can do the level without a mistake. no messing with healths and lives and
whatnot. just pure movement and shooting.
</p>

<p>
and now come the enemies. i&apos;d represent the enemies as spheres. the projectiles
are also spheres so the collision detection becomes quite easy if you only have
the spheres to spheres case and spheres to a static geometry. and drawing them
is quite easy too: all you need to draw is a quad with a special shader that can
correctly project a spherical texture to that quad with a 3d effect. you don&apos;t
really need full human-like geometry to make the shooter fun. you usually need 3
pieces of information about an enemy:
</p>

<ul><li>
  position of the enemy,
</li><li>
  the direction of the enemy&apos;s movement,
</li><li>
  the intent of the enemy.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the position is quite easy to solve: the enemies have a face. you know the enemy
is facing towards you if you see their face. you just need to map the texture
correctly.
</p>

<p>
you can implement the intent easily too: you just draw a different face for
different action. e.g. if the enemy is preparing to shoot you, you could have a
texture where one of their eyes is closed and they are squinting. of if they
want to dodge, you just draw a big open mouth suggesting they are taking in air
for the jump and have their eyes look into the direction of they planned dodge.
</p>

<p>
the direction of movement is a bit trickier since you can&apos;t represent that with
texture tricks. you need two things: you need to implement &quot;bobbing&quot; during the
movement. basically the sphere should move slightly up and down to indicate the
movement. this is important because if they are moving towards or away from you,
this would be your primary hint. secondly, you need to implement a &quot;footsteps&quot;
like effect. basically every half a second add a quickly fading smoke effect in
their position at the given time. the point is that you should be able to see
the trail of their recent movement. this and the bobbing should be more than
enough indication of the direction. although the technique is relatively simple,
it needs a lot of finesse to get it right for maximum utility.
</p>

<p>
as for enemies, i wouldn&apos;t go overboard either. i&apos;d implement only 3 enemies:
</p>

<ul><li>
  biter
</li><li>
  diver
</li><li>
  spitter
</li>
</ul>

<p>
all three enemies would be quite mobile. if you shoot towards them, they will
try to dodge the projectile. so you actually need to get close to them to battle
with them. the game would be about close to mid range combat. of course that
doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t land the occasional lucky shot but it should be rare (but
incredibly satisfying). and of course the enemies have only one health too, so
the challenge is all about hitting them while avoiding their attacks. as for
differentiating the enemies: i&apos;d just probably color their spheres differently
and that&apos;s it.
</p>

<p>
biters are enemies that try to run towards you, jump on you and then bite your
head off. they are quite easy to deal with as long as you don&apos;t let them get too
close. if you do, you have to very carefully dodge their jumps.
</p>

<p>
divers are flying enemies that fly near you and once close, they dive towards
you. very similar to biters the only difference is that they are not constrained
to the floor. some doom levels have flying enemies, and having some vertical
enemies adds some extra flavor to the game anyways.
</p>

<p>
spitters also run towards you until they get to a mid range, and then they shoot
projectiles at you. they should be the closest that come to playing against
other players. and your projectile avoiding techniques must be top notch to
avoid their attacks. they should be able to predict your movements via simple
linear interpolation and thus you can&apos;t simply run around to avoid attacks, you
would need to move in a completely inpredictable way (which i often struggle
with). they can&apos;t spray projectiles like you can do, but if there are multiple
ones, that means a lot of projectiles to avoid.
</p>

<p>
in general i wouldn&apos;t put too many enemies on the map since you only have one
health. too many enemies would just a grind anyways. maybe about 3-7 enemies per
room depending on the size of the current room. that should provide plenty of
spatial challenge in avoiding the attacks, and a tactical challenge in shooting
them all quickly enough.
</p>

<p>
so that pretty much sums it up. i know one could extend this with gazillions of
stuff. but if i were to make a basic game, i would totally start with only that.
i think the above should be more than possible to finish someone in a few months
from total scratch in c and yet still end up with a quite nice game that doesn&apos;t
need a lot of polish.
