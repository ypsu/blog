i keep my work laptop under my desk.
i plug an external monitor, keyboard, mouse into it.
i basically use it as a workstation.
therefore its builtin webcam and microphone are not really accessible to me.
these days i use a smartphone for the meetings.
i was wondering,
could i still use my laptop and just present a nice avatar on meetings?
</p>

<p>
an avatar that would stand still if i wasn&apos;t doing active.
but it would talk if i talked.
or it would be nodding yes or no if i wanted to be nodding.
nothing fancy, but streaming simple, manually controlled, precanned animations.
</p>

<p>
if you are a sensible person, you would use open broadcaster software for this.
but obviously i&apos;m too cheapskate to install and learn new free software.
so i decided to find my own ways to solve this problem.
the information here is absolutely of no use for anyone (if not harmful),
i just thought i document it for my own future reference.
(so that i have more content to facepalm myself about when i get old.)
</p>

<p>
i chose phoenix wright from the ace attorney game as my virtual avatar.
it&apos;s about an attorney who must solve crimes right in the courtroom.
his iconic move is saying &quot;objection&quot; whenever he hears a contradiction.
it&apos;s a gameboy game and i found gif rips online.
i found 9 animations i liked:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. just standing (and occasionally blinking)
</li><li>
  2. normal talking (this is what i&apos;d use when i talk)
</li><li>
  3. determined talking (he leans in as he talks)
</li><li>
  4. thinking pose
</li><li>
  5. talking in the thinking pose
</li><li>
  6. ashamed talking
</li><li>
  7. nodding yes
</li><li>
  8. nodding no
</li><li>
  9. despair pose
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it doesn&apos;t have to be anime characters.
one could prerecord short loops of themselves too.
the point is that i have 9 mpg files called 1.mpg ... 9.mpg,
and that all these animations can be looped.
i want a little interface where i can choose the currently looping animation.
</p>

<p>
since the original art was gifs, i converted them into mpg files like this:
</p>

<pre>
  ffmpeg -re -i phoenix/anim008.gif -map 0:v -pix_fmt yuv420p \
    -filter:v crop=960:540:0:0 3.mpg
</pre>

<p>
then i needed a virtual webcam to stream these gifs into.
i created one like this:
</p>

<pre>
  modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1
</pre>

<p>
now comes the tricky part.
it&apos;s pretty easy to stream a particular video into such a virtual webcam.
however what i want here is a little control box,
with which i can dynamically change what i stream into the webcam.
one obvious idea is to have ffmpeg loop a video statically into the webcam.
whenever i want to change the animation,
i kill the current ffmpeg and start a new one with the new animation.
this felt unclean.
and sometimes it messed up the virtual webcam.
it was flaky due to unclean exits, i presume.
i needed a saner solution.
preferably something that doesn&apos;t really require me to code up anything.
i found a very ugly hack which allowed me to do this.
</p>

<p>
ffmpeg has a feature where you can tell it to load a list of files from a file.
it can then concatenate those files and loop them.
so i created a simple loop.txt containing these two files:
</p>

<pre>
  file a.mpg
  file b.mpg
</pre>

<p>
i instruct ffmpeg to loop concatenating these two files.
in order to switch animation,
i just replace these files with the new animation.
yes, i need two separate files.
otherwise ffmpeg doesn&apos;t reopen the file.
it would keep playing the old animation even if i overwrote the underlying file.
i guess this makes sense from an optimization perspective.
</p>

<p>
so then i just wrote a script that reads digits and rewrites files in a loop.
i had one extra requirement though.
my animation selection console is running in a terminal.
the vidconf software is running in a browser.
i wanted to be able to mute and unmute straight from the terminal script.
so for that i used xdotool.
whenever i press the 0 key i do this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. focus the browser,
</li><li>
  2. send the mute/unmute keybinding,
</li><li>
  3. focus back the terminal.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
ugh, i know.
for reference here&apos;s the full bash monstrosity:
</p>

<pre>
  #/bin/bash
  echo select the browser window with the vidconf.
  current=$(xdotool getactivewindow)
  browser=$(xdotool selectwindow)
  echo
</pre>

<pre>
  # remind myself of my options.
  echo &apos;1watch        2talk         3determined&apos;
  echo &apos;4thinking     5thinktalk    6ashamedtalk&apos;
  echo &apos;7yes          8no           9despair&apos;
</pre>

<pre>
  # set the inital, standing only animation.
  cp 1.mpg a.mpg
  cp 1.mpg b.mpg
  # start the endless ffmpeg stream.
  ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stream_loop -1 -re -f concat -i loop.txt -map 0:v \
    -f v4l2 -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -filter:v crop=960:540:0:0 \
    /dev/video2 &amp;
  # read the requested animation from the keyboard.
  while read -sn1 choice; do
    if ! [[ &quot;$choice&quot; =~ ^[0-9]$ ]]; then
      continue
    fi
    if test &quot;$choice&quot; == 0; then
      # mute or unmute.
      xdotool windowactivate --sync &quot;$browser&quot;
      xdotool key ctrl+d
      xdotool windowactivate &quot;$current&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null
      continue;
    fi
    # set the newly desired animation.
    cp $choice.mpg tmp
    mv tmp a.mpg
    cp $choice.mpg tmp
    mv tmp b.mpg
  done
</pre>

<p>
it&apos;s a terrible way to do this but it works okay.
i&apos;m pretty sure the gazillion ways to do this better.
the main limitation is that it can only switch to the next animation,
when the current animation has finished.
so it only works with short animations.
but that was the case for me so that wasn&apos;t a big deal.
i don&apos;t really use this thing often though,
but sounded like a fun enough solution to share.
</p>

<h2 id="sembr">sembr</h2>
<p>
if you are reading the html version of this on a desktop,
then open the developer console (key f12, usually) and enter this:
</p>

<pre>
  document.head.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;style&gt;p{white-space:pre-wrap;}&lt;/style&gt;&quot;;
</pre>

<p>
this will make this post look use the semantic linebreaks too.
</p>

<p>
semantic linebreaks is an old idea where you put a newline after a thought ends.
basically a newline after the periods or thought joining commas.
previously i used to format my plaintext to 80 characters.
i never really liked the &quot;write a paragraph per line&quot; style of editing.
now i think semantic linebreaks are superior to 80 character wrapping.
first, it has many technological advantages.
you don&apos;t have to reformat your lines after each edit.
that takes out a lot of churn out of this old style text editing.
making edits with a line oriented editor like vim also gets easier.
it&apos;s super easy to shuffle text around, or just rewrite small parts.
such edits look much simpler in text diffing tools too.
</p>

<p>
then there&apos;s the other, emotional aspect of it.
now keep in mind, that i still limit myself to 80 characters per line.
with sembreaks this means that all my thoughts must fit 80 characters.
i still permit separate clauses to spill onto separate lines though.
i used this style for a few weeks now in personal writing.
it does feel that it makes my sentencer simpler, perhaps more childish.
but i feel more clarity out of them.
this way i must find the beginning and the end of each thought.
each thought must be short and must stand on its own.
i can&apos;t drone on and on without saying anything.
i feel that this creative limitation helps me to think.
it forces me to break down those swirling thoughts into digestible pieces.
</p>

<p>
i think, though not sure how to show, but this makes reading easier too.
think of the process of programming.
we also put all the statements onto their own, separate lines.
it would look weird if you would format code to 80 characters.
it just feels cleaner when done this way.
so why wouldn&apos;t we want this extra clarity from ordinary text too?
</p>

<p>
this method does make text use up more vertical space.
in some cases this can be a disadvantage.
perhaps in the ancient times the paper was expensive.
or people don&apos;t like overly thick books.
but on computer screen i think the extra height is not an issue.
</p>

<p>
i tried to convert ordinary text into sembreak&apos;d style with this script:
</p>

<pre>
  document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/[:;.?!,] /g, &apos;$&amp;&lt;br&gt;&apos;)
</pre>

<p>
it didn&apos;t work.
if something wasn&apos;t written with the 80 character / thought limit,
then sembreaks won&apos;t make it easier to read.
</p>

<p>
it also initally makes the text to look like poetry.
it adds some rythm to the text and it feels a little bit weird to read.
search for &quot;ventilated prose&quot; and see the discussion around this.
with that search term you&apos;ll see so other examples of this style.
but i see that a lot of examples are splitting mid-thought.
they use super narrow margins.
they never really recommend a specific character limit.
they let people go with their gut feelings of what is long.
i don&apos;t really like this approach, i prefer static limits.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s also a lot of discussion about how manual wrapping is 70-ies tech.
that this day and age we should just write full paragraphs per line.
i don&apos;t really have a good argument against this.
if people don&apos;t mind relying on fancy text editors for text editing,
then they should go for it.
i&apos;m old school, and i like relying on less tech to do simple things.
hence i wrap manually and now semantically.
besides, if you write markdown or html, the renderers will reformat anyways.
</p>

<p>
i started writing my personal emails with this style.
my emails are always plaintext.
looks like nobody was bothered enough to complain about this style.
maybe people don&apos;t mind reading text like this.
i&apos;m now trying to write my work emails like this too and see how it goes.
maybe the idea catches on eventually.
maybe someone else will start communicating with me with this style.
then, hopefully, i&apos;ll be able to tell if it really makes things nicer or not.
for now i&apos;ll just keep the solo experiment going.
</p>

<h2 id="touch">touch</h2>
<p>
i&apos;m quite a reserved person. it&apos;s quite hard for me to verbally express my
wishes. i often don&apos;t even know what i want. and when i do, then i worry that if
i express it to the other person, they will get offended about me and it just
ruins the relationship. i&apos;m always on the lookout for things that make human
interactions a little bit easier.
</p>

<p>
i like receiving and giving touch quite much. but people have very diverse
preferences about what is an okay touch and what is not. so i tend to err on the
conservative side and just keep to myself. otherwise i&apos;d need to communicate
with people. fortunately i found a very nice but very simple game that can free
up people from all the worries when it comes to touch. and you can play this
with any willing person. it&apos;s called the &quot;3 minute game&quot; and was popularized by
betty martin.
</p>

<p>
first, let&apos;s talk about some aspects of the &quot;wheel of consent&quot;, or a simplified
version of it. each act a human does can be categorized into one of the
following 4 dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  giving: i&apos;m doing something to someone for their benefit
</li><li>
  receiving: someone does something to me for my own benefit
</li><li>
  taking: i&apos;m doing something to someone for my own benefit
</li><li>
  allowing: someone does something to me for their benefit
</li>
</ul>

<p>
they complement each other. when person a is giving to b, then b is receiving.
if person a is taking from b, person b is allowing. you can draw this in a fancy
circle, that&apos;s where the name &quot;wheel of consent&quot; comes from.
</p>

<p>
how much giving, receiving, taking, allowing a person does, matters. each person
has a healthy limit for each dimension. going over we get to the &quot;shadow sides&quot;
of the dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much giving: martyr, self sacrificer
</li><li>
  too much receiving: freeloader, entitled
</li><li>
  too much taking: raper, stealer
</li><li>
  too much allowing: pushover, endurer
</li>
</ul>

<p>
you want to ensure that every act for everyone involved remains in the inner,
non-shadow side of the dimensions.
</p>

<p>
next up, you really need to understand which dimension each act is in for each
person involved. suppose you regularly do an activity (e.g. foot massage). you
think you are doing it as a favor for person b so you are in the giving
dimension. for the other person that activity is in the allowing dimension. they
let you do it because they think you like doing it. but giving and allowing are
not complementary dimensions. it turns out nobody really wants that activity yet
none of the people involved realize this. this is basically a variant of the
abilene paradox. there&apos;s also the flipside to this: you often don&apos;t do some acts
because you think the other person wouldn&apos;t like it. however it might be the
case they would allow you to experiment with it. but you don&apos;t even ask because
of the fear of rejection.
</p>

<p>
the &quot;3 minute game&quot; is a short game that helps you structure communication along
those 4 dimensions. it helps you do activities where it is super clear who it is
for. it consists of four 3 minute rounds. in round 1 player a asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like me to touch you for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person a will be doing something to person b for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective the activity is giving, from
person b&apos;s perspective it is a receiving activity. keep in mind that person a
shouldn&apos;t sink to the shadow sides of their dimension, they should only do what
they are comfortable to give to the other person. in other words they have to
consent to the act. if person a is not happy with the arrangement, they might
negotiate a little bit what their limits are and then agree on that. on the
flipside person b might just want a boring neck massage. it doesn&apos;t have to
sexual all the time. person a has to accept that in this round it&apos;s all about
person b&apos;s wishes. once everybody is happy agreed on the activity, person a does
the agreed on touch for 3 minutes. then person b thanks for person a for this.
</p>

<p>
in round 2, player a again asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like to touch me for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person b will be doing something to person a for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective this is allowing, while from
person b&apos;s perspective this is taking. the same negotiation and consent process
happens just as before. person b might be very horny and might want to crazy
stuff. person a must realize that this is fine to express and that they don&apos;t
have to succumb to the shadow side, they can refuse and person b shall respect
that otherwise they are succumbing to the shadow side. once agreed, person b
does the activity for 3 minutes. again, since this was for person b&apos;s benefit,
person b thanks person a for the act.
</p>

<p>
round 3 and 4 is the same as round 1 and 2 but with the other person asking the
questions. the whole thing takes about 15 minutes and is worth every minute of
it.
</p>

<p>
this game might sound a little bit silly at first. but what makes it truly
remarkable is that it makes you stop for a minute and think. the question might
initially look simple enough but answering them often is quite hard. it&apos;s very
rare that we get a question on what we want. often i don&apos;t even know what sort
of touch i really want but this lets me think deep on what sort of thing would
fill me up now the best. and i can be very selfish in these thoughts, i don&apos;t
need to play an internal chess to ensure whatever i want is something compatible
with my partner. or that if i ask for this particular thing then my relationship
would spoil a bit. the flipside is true too: my partner can think of anything.
even if i don&apos;t really like the requested activity, i&apos;m certainly willing to
give it 3 minutes, whatever it is. it can be a really freeing sensation once you
experience this game in a safe and supportive environment. you feel like you can
ask for anything and not be judged. you can say anything you want. i haven&apos;t
really tried it in a non-sexual environment so i don&apos;t know how well it works
there but i&apos;d suspect it should hold up quite well there as well. you can see
sample sessions from such environment in betty&apos;s original videos and you can
see the participants happy with the game. betty&apos;s videos are well worth a watch.
</p>

<p>
in the original documentation of this game, betty mentions that this is a game
for 2 or more people. the &quot;or more&quot; version is quite intriguing to me. she
didn&apos;t really explain that part as far as i remember. i&apos;m not entirely sure how
that would work. e.g. how could 3 people play this game? i think what you can do
is that rather than a single person asking the questions, 2 people ask the
questions together to the 3rd person. the third person then can come up with
activities that involve the first two people doing something to the third and
only proceed with the act if everyone agrees to it without succumbing to the
shadow sides. i guess that&apos;s how the &quot;or more&quot; works: each round a selected
person has to ask the group for something they can do together for the selected
person&apos;s benefit. it probably scales okay to 4 people but afterwards i&apos;d imagine
it has way too much communication overhead. never tried this though so not sure
how transformative experience the group setting is yet.
</p>

<p>
the wheel of consent itself is a quite generic concept. it can apply in other
cases as well, not just the above game. e.g. you get invited to a party. do you
go or not? who benefits from you going to the party? it is an interesting
viewpoint to see our activities from. and things can get complicated: you only
benefit from the party if some other person also goes. and that other person
only benefits if you go. now you have these complex, conditional scenarios that
i can&apos;t really wrap my head around yet, so i&apos;ll not dig into this aspect. i&apos;m
just trying to popularize this wheel of consent concept because looks like it&apos;s
a useful framework to work with.
</p>

<p>
if you ever try this game then let me know how it went and what your experiences
with it were.
</p>

<h2 id="talking">talking</h2>
<p>
suppose you have a friend or three. i like to imagine such hypothetical
scenarios. and further imagine that you throw or are invited to a small party
with them. what do you really do there? i don&apos;t really like music, dancing,
drinking and such. i&apos;m more of a sit in the quiet corner and listen to other
people sort of person. maybe play some game. but what game?
</p>

<p>
ideally it will be a game that isn&apos;t too complex and doesn&apos;t really require too
many props. i very quickly lose interest in games with many rules. and even if
you can follow them all, what&apos;s the point in playing such a game? i feel it&apos;s
just killing time. if i am already with people, i&apos;d want a game that focuses on
the people instead. it should make it possible for me to learn more about others
to see what people they really are. so basically i just want some structured
talking instead and the &quot;game&quot; could provide the structure.
</p>

<p>
one popular simple party game is cards against humanity. there is a list of
cards with questions on it, face down. each turn a player (called the czar)
turns a question card up and people have to come up with a witty answer to it.
each player has 10 cards with pre-written answer cards from which they can
choose from. or one could play this even without pre-written answers and rely on
people&apos;s inner creativity to come up with witty answers. the person who turned
up the question card has to pick the wittiest response. the owner of that
response wins the round. the answer cards should be shuffled before the czar
evaluates to avoid biased selection. this would be harder in the handwritten,
artisan answers but one could solve that by writing the responses on a
smartphone.
</p>

<p>
this is quite a fun game, potentially leading to fun times. the downside is that
you don&apos;t learn much from the other people, only their wittiness. so i was
looking for other similar games with more focus on the people themselves. and i
found some! and the rules are even simpler. i found two games and they go with
the names of &quot;disturbing friends&quot; and &quot;voting game&quot; and sort of came up with my
own rules based on the ideas behind these games.
</p>

<p>
the first game has question cards which contain a question and 2 to 4 answers. a
player, the round&apos;s czar, turns up a question card. the other players have to
guess how the czar will answer the question. the czar must try to answer the
question as honestly as they can. often there are no correct answers. in such
case the czar must pick the answer closest to their heart. each player has some
voting cards each with a number from 1 to 4. every player has to pick their
answer and put the corresponding voting card in front of them, face down. once
each player has voted, people reveal their vote one by one and finally the czar
reveals their answer. the czar wins (or loses depending on perspective) the
round if half or more of people didn&apos;t guess the answer correctly.
</p>

<p>
depending on the questions this can be quite fun with unexpected twists. you can
have a neutral question like &quot;best pet: cat/dog/fish&quot; and learn what animal the
czar likes. the czar also learns what other people&apos;s impressions of him are. you
can have a more politically motivated question like &quot;gun ownership: yes to
all/only license/banned completely&quot; to learn how people think politically. or
you can have a question like &quot;polyamory: it&apos;s a bad idea/ok but not for me/i am
polyamorous&quot; to learn other people&apos;s inclinations. the nice thing here is that
the game brings up the question, you don&apos;t really have to awkwardly bring it up
yourself in case you are curious about people&apos;s opinions on a topic. or you can
have a dirty nsfw question like &quot;my crotch has (select first that apply):
jewelry/scar tissue/ tattoo/other surprise&quot;. this is where the unexpected twists
can occur: maybe some people get intrigued by the czar&apos;s answer and then the
czar flashes their body to the party. that certainly could result in a lot of
fun from then on!
</p>

<p>
the ideal number of people for this game is about 4 so that the czar can see the
opinion of 3 people which is not too little, nor too much. but i think a couple
or a pair of people could also play this game. in such case the goal remains to
guess the other person&apos;s answer and see how well the two people know each other
and learn more about each other.
</p>

<p>
the other game is a bit simpler because it doesn&apos;t have a czar. you don&apos;t have
questions here but rather statements. each person gets assigned a distinct
number from 1 to n before the game starts. each round the group turns up a
statement card. people then have to vote which person is best described by the
statement. the round is won (or lost depending on perspective) by the person
acquiring the most votes. if there is a tie, people can break that verbally by
arguing who should be the winner.
</p>

<p>
a neutral question could be something like &quot;... cooks the best&quot;. people can then
see whose cooking they find the best. a more interesting one could be &quot;... can
hold their breath the longest&quot;. people might contest the result of the vote and
a fun breath holding contest might start. a nsfw statement might be &quot;... wants
to hang around naked&quot;. people then could then ask the winner &quot;do you really want
to be naked&quot; and maybe the party pivots into a fun naked party!
</p>

<p>
this game is probably best played with 5 people so that there are less chances
for ties. but i think this one could be played by a couple too. the couple just
decides between each other who wins each statement.
</p>

<p>
in order to play this game, one needs voting cards. one solution is to take
postit notes and write some numbers on them. the other solution is to cut up an
a4 paper into small slips and write some number on them. or even less effort
would be to find some coins or other small items. when you want to vote for 3,
you put 3 coins into your hand under the table and then show your hand when your
time comes. one doesn&apos;t need elaborate equipment or boards to play these games.
</p>

<p>
there could be some punishment or reward for the losers and winners each round.
ideas:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the losers have to make 5 pushups or squats each time,
</li><li>
  the winners can consume something of their preference,
</li><li>
  they need to remove or acquire a piece of clothing,
</li><li>
  they choose the background music for the next round,
</li><li>
  others can draw funny stuff on their faces or body,
</li><li>
  they need to be standing for the next round.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it doesn&apos;t really matter much what it is but if there&apos;s some form of feedback
then that raises the stakes a bit and makes the game a bit more interesting. the
party members much agree on this beforehand so that everybody is comfortable
with the punishments.
</p>

<p>
one could print the question and statement cards but i don&apos;t think it&apos;s
necessary. as long as one has an app loaded with bunch of questions, one could
just use a smartphone to present the questions. ideally people should source
their own questions. nevertheless i decided to collect some sample questions and
statements and make a small tool for it that is convenient to use from a
smartphone. i even separated out the nsfw stuff so you can even play this in a
family friendly setting. but a warning: the nsfw stuff is quite strong, i
believe. only enable it with friends you absolutely trust no matter what happens
or people you don&apos;t know at all so that there are less stakes in the manner. if
in doubt, just look up the list of questions in the source of the webpage before
playing the game. the webpage has no dependencies so feel free to copy it
somewhere and edit the list of questions in it, e.g. remove the potentially
offending ones and add your topics of interest. you can find my tool here:
</p>

<ul><li>
  https://notech.ie/cards
</li>
</ul>

<p>
load that on a smartphone, select your list and put it into the middle of the
table and keep pressing next as the rounds progress. it has about 30 cards for
each type. if you ever try it then let me know how it went. i never tried this
so caveat emptor. maybe i&apos;ll have the chance to try this one day (with the nsfw
stuff included) and then i can improve it or list more tips here.
</p>
