<h2 id="phones">phones</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>thoughts about phones now that i have to buy a new one.</p>
<p>
this year (2021) swisscom decided to shut down its 2g network.
i got no warning about this, my phone just suddenly stopped working.
it took me quite a while to guess that 2g might be gone
and then confirming in the news that it&apos;s indeed very likely.
apparently i might have been the only person in switzerland
who still used 2g phones.
to be fair, this is a corporate subscription
so maybe my workplace got a warning about this via snail mail.
it would have been nice to give a few days headsup via sms too though.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve switched to a dumbphone in 2015 after 1.5 years of using a smartphone.
i got my first smartphone (nexus4) from my workplace in 2013.
but it was quite addictive for me,
i was checking it way too often rather than being present in the world.
the constant updates were also super annoying.
almost as if every month there is some big os update
that takes ages to install and then it changes the user interface subtly enough
so that you can throw out some of your muscle memory all the time.
but what really pissed me up is that they break very quickly
and you are then expected to get a new phone.
after a year or so it started occassionally rebooting.
it even rebooted at night.
back then i had to have mandatory encryption due to corp policy
and you would need to enter your unlock pattern to boot.
this meant that on some nights it decided to reboot
then the next morning i got no alarm or page notifications at all
until i woke up naturally.
and i was pretty sure this was a software problem only present with wifi on,
but on support all i got that the phone is end of life, i should get a new one.
i really hate this planned obsolescence attitude
so i decided to get rid of smartphones from my life.
</p>

<p>
i had the first generation nokia 105 from 2013 that i bought in 2015.
it had none of the issues that i had with the smartphone.
i also felt that i got generally calmer.
this nokia aged quite well.
it still functioned well
although the letters/numbers from its keypad completely faded away.
i could type blind on this so this wasn&apos;t bothering me that much.
separate buttons would have been nice though.
later models had keypads like that.
anyways, i wanted a similar phone that would work with the new networks.
</p>

<p>
in the meantime i dusted off the new corporate pixel 4
that i got from the company last year when i moved to switzerland.
i only got it because i thought i&apos;ll need it for work (a special app)
but then it turned out i don&apos;t so i didn&apos;t use it
and couldn&apos;t be bothered to return it.
i&apos;ve put in the sim card and it worked fine.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve spent some time on this android to make it somewhat usable.
this entails removing all the unnecessary apps,
turning off unnecessary features (animations: what&apos;s the point of this?),
and other tweaks.
i&apos;ve disabled data and wifi, enabled battery saver.
basically i&apos;ve managed to turn it into a dumbphone.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about the old nokia that its battery lasted for weeks.
i thought all these fancy new phones can&apos;t last a day even.
i was quite surprised to learn that the pixel4 with the latest android
could probably last for a week even.
it drained only about 12-15% battery per day.
</p>

<p>
my phone usage other than to check the time is very light:
i only use it to set alarms for wakeup and for meeting reminders,
and some evenings i use its flashlight to see in the dark rather than lamps
because i don&apos;t want to accidentally wake my kid with the extra light.
secondary reason is to receive pages when i&apos;m oncall at work.
and on very rare occasions i also use the sms and calling features.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d wager that 99% of the time my phone is on standby.
it would be nice if i didn&apos;t need to mess around with chargers every day.
after learning the pixel4 can probably survive a week
i even considered just staying with it.
</p>

<p>
but there were a few things bothering me.
</p>

<p>
its size was much bigger than my old nokia.
it didn&apos;t fit as nicely into my pocket.
it felt quite bulky.
</p>

<p>
i missed the good old buttons.
there were mornings when i was trying to disable the morning alarm via swiping
and my swipes just didn&apos;t register.
and the alarm just got louder and louder (note: i&apos;m not living alone).
that was frustrating, let&apos;s say to the least.
in retrospect i learned
that i could have probably used the side buttons for this.
</p>

<p>
i do appreciate that a touchscreen is more generic interface,
but i prefer buttons.
i find them more reliable.
it happens often on various screens that my finger doesn&apos;t register,
especially when i&apos;m in a less than ideal conditions.
i might use the phone rarely but when i use it, i really need it to work.
i prefer reliability over &quot;usefulness&quot;.
in other words, i wish for a keypad.
</p>

<p>
the fact that pixel4 is a smartphone also bothered me for several reasons.
</p>

<p>
although i deleted all the apps from it,
it would be very trivial for me to reenable data
and start browsing crap when i feel uncomfortable at some place.
sure, i could probably resist this for quite a while
since i didn&apos;t associate internet with my phone for 6 years
but i&apos;m sure it would all come back over time.
i&apos;d very quickly adapt to it
and then couldn&apos;t live without it (e.g. to live without gps).
and i&apos;m also sure that if i&apos;d start using this more heavily
then it would start having problems like i had with the nexus4
(even if it&apos;s just the annoying updates in case the hardware remains good).
i can safe myself a lot of mental health
if i completely cut myself from this addiction device.
</p>

<p>
also, if it&apos;s a smartphone device and if others see it,
i feel that they will have different expectations from you.
they might expect that you are on whatsapp, messenger, viber, snapchat
or whatever today&apos;s messenger apps are.
while if all you have is a dumbphone,
they&apos;ll consider you as a weirdo and won&apos;t have much expectations from you.
it&apos;s a good conversation starter too
if you are hipster enough to flash it now and then in front of others.
</p>

<p>
besides, one needs to show a good example for the next generation:
that one doesn&apos;t need a smartphone to survive in society.
maybe this way i can somewhat delay my kid&apos;s smartphone addiction.
</p>

<p>
anyways, long story short: i still wanted an old fashioned dumbphone.
easy peasey, i say to myself:
let&apos;s check out nokia&apos;s newest models.
</p>

<p>
the newest nokia 105 (2019) can&apos;t do 3g or 4g.
but nokia 225 4g can!
it even has a camera.
i don&apos;t really need a camera but at least that is not that addictive
so that doesn&apos;t bother me too much.
i almost bought this on the spot but then i noticed one little detail
as i was comparing its specs with my old phone: the size.
</p>

<p>
here are the sizes of these 3 phones for reference:
</p>

<ul><li>
  107.0 x 44.8 x 14.3 mm: nokia 105 (2013)
</li><li>
  124.7 x 51.0 x 13.7 mm: nokia 225 4g (2020)
</li><li>
  147.1 x 68.8 x  8.2 mm: pixel 4 (2019)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the new phone i&apos;ve looked up is much much bigger!
this must be some weird model then, i thought.
but all the other phones grew too, even the new nokia 105 models:
</p>

<ul><li>
  119.0 x 49.2 x 14.4 mm: nokia 105 (2019)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
or compare my wife&apos;s very old dumbphone from her teenager times
with a new model of the same number:
</p>

<ul><li>
  108.8 x 46.2 x 11.7 mm: nokia 6303 classic (2009)
</li><li>
  131.4 x 53.0 x 13.7 mm: nokia 6300 4g (2020)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i recall from my childhood that the adults complained
about the phones getting way too small.
looks like in 2021 you can&apos;t get small phones anymore that are 3g/4g.
</p>

<p>
after researching a lot on the internet,
i&apos;ve found pretty much only these phones with comparable size of my old phone:
</p>

<ul><li>
  104.8 x 54.5 x 18.7 mm: nokia 2720 flip (2019); 192.7 mm when opened; kaios
</li><li>
   61.0 x 30.0 x 16.5 mm: zanco tiny t2 (2020); 3g dumbphone
</li><li>
   92.4 x 43.0 x 13.3 mm: unihertz jelly pro (2017); android 8
</li><li>
   95.9 x 55.9 x 8.79 mm: light phone ii (2019): &quot;light os&quot; (modified android)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
maybe there are more but these are the ones i found.
all of these phones support at least 3g and you can message too.
(i&apos;ve seen some phones which can only do calls but i ignored those.)
</p>

<p>
oh, and based on the specs and the reviews,
none of these phones can last for a week.
which is odd because nokia claims to work for 28 days in 3g mode, 20 in 4g,
yet 4 days is the longest duration i found in the customer reviews.
but it runs kaios so i guess that&apos;s a huge battery drain at this point.
i&apos;m sad that battery duration also became a lost art over time.
</p>

<p>
let me immediately eliminate the jelly pro:
it&apos;s a full smartphone and it comes with all the downsides.
besides, for some reason you can&apos;t easily update past android 8,
so it probably has worse battery management.
the reviews say it works for about a day.
(iirc battery management gets better with android versions.
i guess developers are slowly learning that not running the apps constantly
makes the battery last longer.
probably the newer android builds have longer sleep cycles.)
</p>

<p>
at this point i pretty much gave up on the battery front
and resolved to charging my phone every day.
so i decided battery shouldn&apos;t be deciding factor for me.
</p>

<p>
at first i was eyeballing the light phone.
it&apos;s an e-ink android phone that has a hardcoded dumbphone app running on it.
technically you can get to the underlying full android phone,
but it&apos;s a bit of a challenge and defeats the purpose of the phone anyways.
it has no flashlight and no buttons.
it&apos;s quite expensive too ($350).
and you&apos;d need to wait several months before they get another batch to ship.
with all this together it was easy for me to say no to this phone too.
</p>

<p>
i was then eyeing for that zanco phone.
there were a few things bothering me about it:
it might be too small and i&apos;m not sure about the quality:
in some video reviews i&apos;ve seen the reviewer struggling to press some buttons.
and i&apos;d have to order it from china
which means it would take ages to arrive and i&apos;d need to pay import taxes too.
oh and it doesn&apos;t have a flashlight.
</p>

<p>
and then there&apos;s that nokia 2720 flipphone.
it no longer uses nokia&apos;s standard dumbphone os but rather kaios.
kaios, iiuc, is like android but for phones with buttons.
it&apos;s a fork of mozilla&apos;s defunct firefox os.
basically the whole os is just a webbrowser running in a linux
and all the apps are just html5 pages.
this totally makes sense to me but the battery time worries me
because i don&apos;t really associate the web with efficiency.
and since it&apos;s all web based maybe it could run the addictive apps too.
but otherwise it does check okay on other dimensions:
has flashlight and buttons, doesn&apos;t look like a smartphone,
i can call and message with it.
it can even act as a wifi hotspot to share the mobile internet,
which i&apos;m not sure is good or not,
since then i can easily use a secondary device to browse internet anywhere.
but it&apos;s a bit too big for my taste:
bigger than my old nokia 105 even when closed.
i couldn&apos;t find a smaller phone though, so i can&apos;t be very picky.
</p>

<p>
btw, if the size didn&apos;t bother me that much,
i&apos;d have probably gone with energizer e241s.
it&apos;s also a kaios phone but the reviewers were happy with the battery life
and pretty much was the cheapest at the time (40 chf).
for reference the nokia2720 was 82 chf and the zanco $62 + shipping.
</p>

<p>
after contemplating a lot over my choices,
i realized that i can&apos;t make a good decision here.
all choices have some downsides.
i just need to pick one and go with it.
</p>

<p>
my wife suggested that i go with the nokia 2720, it&apos;ll be less hassle.
so i went with that.
i&apos;ll soon post a review of it.
</p>

<h2 id="solomove">solomove</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>another attempt at motivating myself for some exercising.</p>
<p>
i&apos;m quite the passive person.
i pretty much sit all day long in front of my computer at home.
but then there&apos;s everybody saying that some exercising is important.
</p>

<p>
a while ago i thought about how could i trick myself into some exercising.
my goal was not to develop proper exercise routine
just to avoid the absolutely zero exercise living.
i found a way that worked for a while.
i wrote about this in /enacc.
skim that, otherwise some of the things here won&apos;t make sense.
</p>

<p>
i eventually stopped caring about decrementing the enacc energy
because i stopped procrastinating much.
enacc wasn&apos;t the thing that stopped me from procrastinating.
what stopped my bad habits was rather the improved daily routine.
</p>

<p>
nevertheless i tried working on incrementing the energy levels via exercising.
i tried to keep it level across all exercise dimensions.
which means i eventually started doing the exercises in a round robin fashion.
i always pretty much knew which exercise to do at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
i usually stayed on a single exercise until i hit a switch point
at which i started focusing on the next exercise.
the switch point was at every 50 points.
e.g. if all exercises are at 250 points
then i start doing the first one until 300 points,
and then switch to the next exercise.
i don&apos;t do this in a single set.
i usually accumulate 50 points over many sets over several days.
i mostly focused on them in the morning,
since exercise can be a part of the morning routine.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  problem
</p>

<p>
eventually i started dreading the system a little bit.
my problem was the same what i&apos;ve had previously when i tried going to a gym.
i felt it requires too much time investment from me
and i don&apos;t particularly enjoy myself during the exercise.
</p>

<p>
and as i was doing the exercises themselves,
i felt that i focus too much solely on counting the repetitions.
i counted so that i knew my strength
and in order to enter the progress into enacc.
but in the end i felt i did it for the numbers rather than for myself.
i felt the &quot;tyranny of metrics&quot;.
the whole thing felt pointless.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  requirements
</p>

<p>
i really liked one part: enacc always told me what to do.
it&apos;s almost like as if a personal trainer takes care of the &quot;thinking&quot;.
but then i thought, maybe a personal trainer could take of the counting too?
or furthermore: what if i don&apos;t care about counting at all?
do i lose anything?
</p>

<p>
basically here&apos;s what i want:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i don&apos;t need to think or track things during the exercise or in general.
</li><li>
  it requires very little time investment from me.
</li><li>
  something that tells me what to do.
</li><li>
  the exercises should be simple and varied.
</li><li>
  but within a day the exercise pretty much stays the same.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i added the static exercise requirement because i started liking the simplicity
of doing only a single exercise per day from my enacc experience.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  solution
</p>

<p>
i think i managed to come up with a new system that seems to work for me.
i write up the list of exercises to do:
pushups, pullups, squats, dips, bench presses, etc.
then each day i pick a single exercise
and only do that through many small sets throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
i order the exercises into a least recently used list.
then every day i just pop the least recently used exercise
and that will be my exercise for the day.
i then put that exercise to the end of the list.
i also track the date i last used an exercise for reference
but that is not really important.
</p>

<p>
this system tells me what to do for each day.
whenever i decide to do a set, i just do however much i feel like doing.
i don&apos;t track the rep count or the length the exercise because i no longer care.
i don&apos;t particularly feel dread anymore because if i feel i did too little
then i promise to myself that the next set will be harder.
and sometimes it is, sometimes it&apos;s not.
the point is not to have a proper exercise routine
just to avoid the absolutely zero exercise days.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  amount
</p>

<p>
i try to do the exercises in a way that they are hard
and i can&apos;t really do more than, say, 10 reps.
this doesn&apos;t always work because one gets stronger over time.
one learns to do more reps and then needs longer time to get to the amount
that hits the limits of the muscles.
but e.g. i try to do squats while holding weights to make it harder.
</p>

<p>
an ideal set is where i do the exercise until my muscles give up.
and even then a couple more negative versions of the exercise
(e.g. in pullups a negative is when you slowly lower yourself).
iiuc negative exercises are the new hotness, just search for it.
but unfortunately i often give up sooner than i reach this part.
</p>

<p>
in exchange one should do sets all the time throughout the day.
i try to do a few sets in the morning already.
if i don&apos;t forget i do try to do them throughout the day too
but i don&apos;t obsess about it.
if i forget then so be it.
at least i did some in the morning.
</p>

<p>
another thing i find helpful is to do the exercises very slowly.
i find this uses more muscle power
and is actually more closer to the negative exercises.
but i don&apos;t obsess about this either.
sometimes i do things faster, sometimes slower, depending on my mood.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  soreness
</p>

<p>
muscle soreness is my feedback about whether i did something good or not.
if i don&apos;t get sore muscles then it means
i did either too little or the exercise had a way too weak form.
i actually quite enjoy the pain that comes from this
because i learned to associate it with the fact that i did good.
now i actually miss it when i don&apos;t get sore.
so my actual goal is to be sore all the time.
</p>

<p>
i watched a lot of dragon ball z as i was a kid.
and the most important thing i learned from it: no pain no gain.
the heroes got powerful through a lot of pain.
so that show educated me that pain is fine.
</p>

<p>
but i do give myself a free pass for the day if i feel soreness.
iiuc your muscles have to heal, so it&apos;s better to avoid training.
my conscience is still in the clear when i avoid exercise such days.
though if it&apos;s only my legs sore
then i might still pick some upper body exercises to do.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  review
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m using this system for the past few days and i really like it.
it really makes the exercise easy: i don&apos;t really have to think about it.
whenever i&apos;m between things, i stand up and try to do a set if i remember it.
</p>

<p>
and i don&apos;t set any expectations for myself about the sets.
if it&apos;s small, then it&apos;s small.
it really helps me to actually start the exercise
if i know it won&apos;t take too long.
sometimes i still count during it
because counting can make me push harder those last few reps.
sometimes i don&apos;t, and i&apos;ll try to think about something during it.
or sometimes i do it to clear my head:
like in meditation, i try to focus on simply feeling the pain.
and there&apos;s lot to feel once you are at your limits.
</p>

<p>
sometimes (usually?) i don&apos;t get sore muscles the next day.
but that&apos;s fine, i&apos;ll remember that
and maybe i&apos;ll do the same exercise harder or differently next time.
</p>

<p>
i like the least recently used list thing too.
i even added other things to it to remember doing regularly, e.g. cold showers.
i started to end my showers with turning the water to as cold as possible
and have a totally cold shower for a few seconds.
i can&apos;t really last longer than a few seconds.
cold water is painful too but i very much like the feeling right after.
maybe with some exposure i can increase my tolerance over time.
it&apos;s like a form of mental training to learn to endure pain.
but in order to not forget about this habit,
i put it into my lru list to make sure i&apos;m regularly reminded to do it.
i can totally imagine that i might put other things into it over time.
</p>

<p>
one downside of this system is that it really only works from home.
once i need to go back to the office, it&apos;s likely i might stop.
but since i wake up quite early in the morning (i now aim at 5am),
i might still be able to do enough sets in the morning
so that i won&apos;t need to do them at work.
we&apos;ll see.
</p>

<p>
in any case, i&apos;ll keep experimenting with this system and see how it goes.
</p>

<h2 id="seennet">seennet</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>an idea for a social networking site around videocalling.</p>
<p>
i think i like the idea of having community sites with very specific rules.
so here&apos;s one idea that i think is optimized for &quot;meeting&quot; people.
by &quot;meeting&quot; i mean a 10 minute-ish videocall.
this would be a social networking site
where you could interact with others only through videocalls.
</p>

<p>
there are sites like omegle and chatroulette
where you can talk with strangers.
the problem with them is
that you don&apos;t really control what happens after the chat:
you might feel the whole chat was in vain
when a good call ended before exchanging contact data.
</p>

<p>
in seennet you can access a person&apos;s profile only after you&apos;ve met them
and as long as both parties agree to this in a short post-call survey.
after getting the consent from both sides, you would become &quot;friends&quot;.
you would have to regularly meet to maintain the relationship
otherwise seennet would break the connection (e.g. after 18 months).
</p>

<p>
in order to use the site, all you need to configure are the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  your availability for scheduling the meeting events (e.g. mornings),
</li><li>
  your language filters (e.g. you only speak english and german),
</li><li>
  optional geographical filters (e.g. only local people).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
then you would ask seennet to schedule you some videocalls.
</p>

<p>
simply chatting randomly could be boring and pointless.
therefore i&apos;d add a little gamification to all this:
another goal on the site would be to &quot;suggest arrangements&quot;.
suppose you know quite a lot of people
and you know a friend of yours would get along
with another friend of yours very well but they don&apos;t know each other yet.
then you enter this suggestion into the system along with a note
that explains why they might like each other
(e.g. you can mention that they both have the same secret hobby).
then if seennet ever schedules a meeting for them
they both see your note before the meeting
so they know that they have a common friend.
that means they are not so stranger after all
and given the recommendation they have a good chance for connecting well.
</p>

<p>
you could compare this system with online dating sites.
there you create an online profile, add photos, list interests.
then you need to message a lot of people
or hope that the right person messages you.
if you are introvert who is into introverts
then the latter strategy might never connect you up with the ideal partner.
you have to invest a lot of energy into this system.
in seennet you simply need to show up regularly
and after a while you&apos;ll start meeting more like minded people
without any reliance on any fancy algorithm doing the right thing.
</p>

<p>
in those dating sites a lot can matter on your profile.
in seennet you re-present your profile every time you meet a new person.
the first few minutes of your introduction is your &quot;profile&quot;, basically.
the nice thing about this is that your live &quot;profile&quot; can improve over time
because you get constant feedback about it
as you see the other people&apos;s reactions.
you might not be so keen on improving your profile page
simply because you have no idea what effect it has on people.
</p>

<p>
i think this sort of thing could bring together people with many interests
not just romantic partners.
maybe you are into learning german.
every time you introduce yourself,
you also tell people that you want to practice german.
maybe the other person knows someone who also studies german.
they can then add a recommendation with a note like this:
&quot;you both like hiking, want to practice german. you should meet!&quot;.
i think there&apos;s less awkwardness with this sort of introductions
compared to a meeting with a complete stranger.
here at least a friend vouched for the other person,
so you should be a bit of at an ease here.
and you also have a common topic already,
no need to spend a lot of time trying to find it.
</p>

<p>
another weird example could be nudity.
i think it was quite common on chatroulette in its early times
and it was usually unwanted by most people.
on seennet you would initially appear on the calls clothed
but you would mention that you like nude calls.
(being clothed in the random calls could be a rule).
if a person knows two people who like being nude
they can arrange a call between them
and the suggestion note could say:
&quot;you both want to be nude. have a nude chat!&quot;.
then you would have the opportunity to go wild with strangers.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s another psychological aspect here:
you can express your weird wishes in an indirect way.
in a traditional site with direct connections only
you would mostly only experience rejection
since the goal is to connect to the other matched person directly.
but in seennet your only goal is to listen and note the desires
so that you can connect people together.
i think the fear of rejection would diminish on a site like this
since the other person doesn&apos;t really have to like you
in order to still rake in virtual points for successful matching.
</p>

<p>
i think the underlying idea behind seennet is very generic
and can easily adapt to a wider range of interests
than what typical sites usually have.
for instance maybe you are a couple
and looking for another couple to play boardgames (or other fun).
</p>

<p>
you could easily register a &quot;couple&quot; profile
and appear as a couple on all videocalls.
solo people might mention this couple in their other calls
and if there are other people who are interested in some couple fun
they could then also register as a couple.
that solo person can then arrange a meeting between them.
in fact a couple based subculture might appear on the site
even without any specialcasing done on the site itself.
</p>

<p>
i wouldn&apos;t allow any messaging on this platform, only videocalls.
if you want messaging, just connect on some other platform.
i think this limitation would keep things simpler and cleaner.
</p>

<p>
but what would motivate members to keep suggesting connections?
i&apos;d make things a bit more complicated for this.
you&apos;ll see when somebody suggests you a connection
but this in itself won&apos;t increase the odds
that seennet schedules the suggested meeting for you.
in order for it to do that you&apos;d need to &quot;accept&quot; the suggestion.
that would increase the odds
that seennet schedules its random calls with that person.
simply increasing the odds i think is a good defense against spam suggestions.
however if the other side also accepts the suggestion
seennet pretty much immediately schedules the meeting
or tells you that you have a calendar mismatch.
</p>

<p>
the trick is in the &quot;accepting&quot;.
you can&apos;t accept a connection unless you suggest one before.
so basically the site has a currency.
you get credit for suggesting.
maybe also for someone accepting your suggestions.
and accepting suggestions uses up such credit.
to limit spam, i&apos;d only allow suggesting one connection per day.
</p>

<p>
the assumption i&apos;m making here is
that people would feel a strong urge to accept suggestions
since that&apos;s how they can find nice friends.
and this urge will then drive them to suggest connections for others.
</p>

<p>
given that you can only establish new connections
through the random or suggested calls,
one would be quite invested into their profile.
creating a new profile wouldn&apos;t give you much
since it would take a while to build up a larger network
that you could spam effectively.
so i think the spam would be somewhat reduced on the site intrinsically.
people would be motivated to adhere to the rules
otherwise they have a lot to lose (i.e. their network).
</p>

<p>
another benefit of using such a site is
that it takes control of &quot;maintaining&quot; the connections.
i&apos;m really bad at this in real life:
if somebody doesn&apos;t call or write to me then i don&apos;t reach out to them.
for one, i feel shy and feel that i would be disturbing them
if i asked how are things with them.
two, i know that such talking usually starts at and often ends at small talk.
and i&apos;m really bad and uncomfortable at small talk
so i simply avoid it if i can.
but if some entity randomly schedules some videocalls 
then it might help me take care of the anxieties
and the scheduling work around this.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve chosen short online videocalls
because they can fit the modern schedule easier
and give access to many people very conveniently.
i&apos;m sure such things exist in offline world too:
e.g. i think there are apps that arrange lunch mates for you
so you don&apos;t have to eat alone.
in such places arranging dates with others might come less naturally
so that&apos;s why a little gamified site around this could help.
also, lunching can be expensive from both time and money perspective,
hence i think i&apos;d prefer the low cost videocalls.
but i still would want to do it with local people
and that&apos;s why i&apos;d add the option for geographic filtering into the settings.
</p>

<p>
i came to this peer powered matchmaking site idea
while reading fowler&apos;s book called &quot;connected&quot;.
that book talks about social networks/graphs in general.
i really liked the &quot;friend of a friend&quot; aspect:
the number of people you are connected through a friend is quite large.
and your friend often connects you to another of their friend
if they seem that such a friendship would be beneficial.
in fact, this is how a lot of romantic relationships get arranged.
so then i thought how could one build a network around this
and maybe nudge people a little bit to be more active in suggesting.
the above is what i came up with.
</p>

<p>
and these days it&apos;s pretty easy to set up videocalls between people
using all the browser apis.
so i think the implementation of such a site would be relatively simple.
although i&apos;m somewhat unsure if peer-to-peer videocalls should be allowed
or if the videocalls should go through a central server.
i don&apos;t know how bad it is to leak ip addresses these days.
alternatively i&apos;m sure one could use jitsi for this one way or another.
</p>

<p>
if such a site would exist, i might try it.
maybe one day in my distant retirement i might build it
if i still want it and it doesn&apos;t exist yet.

<h2 id="reflecting">reflecting</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>reflect regularly!</p>
<p>
one thought stuck with me from my previous post, /grow.
in there i propose that one should occasionally write answers to 4 questions.
to recap, let me list those 4 questions along with a single word
that summarizes the question&apos;s intent:
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement:
  what achievement of yours are you the most proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  failure: what are you not so proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  goal: name a goal for the next few months.
</li><li>
  peers: name a few people who you interacted with a lot in the past few months.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think these are pretty good questions:
they don&apos;t overwhelm you because they only ask you to list one answer.
even answering with one short sentence is enough.
and just because you list at least one answer,
it already bumps you out of a fully autopilot life.
</p>

<p>
in that post i suggest
that people work on these questions regularly with a mentor.
however what if someone doesn&apos;t have a mentor?
well, i think one should still ask those questions from themselves regularly.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll give it a shot every 4 months or so.
i tried answering those questions and they are not that easy.
as an example here&apos;s what i came up with yesterday after some pondering
(keep in mind that the answers are about the surrounding +/- 4 months):
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement: i&apos;ve created a good daily routine.
</li><li>
  failure: i still distracted myself too often with pointless internet surfing.
</li><li>
  goal: find an accountability partner to grow my peer list.
</li><li>
  peers: my wife only.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it took me a while to answer those questions
but now i feel i have a bit more clarity about where i am and where am i going.
although i&apos;ll try to do this regularly but probably i won&apos;t do it publicly.
i feel doing it publicly would prevent being fully honest with the answers.
the answers could often require a lot of personal context
that would just not make sense without that extra knowledge.
e.g. my &quot;goal&quot; has more nuance to it that i didn&apos;t elaborate above.
or one might not want to publicize their failures and aspirations.
though i might change my mind and i&apos;ll just keep updating this post
or add a new post for every reflection point even if things don&apos;t make sense.
</p>

<p>
note that this reflection doesn&apos;t necessary come with any commitments.
for instance i can now decide
how disturbing the procrastination mentioned in the failure question is.
if it is, i might start tracking it or try to prevent it.
or i might just make a mental note of it (raise mental awareness)
and see how it changes over time.
furthermore, i might make plans to achieve my goal or i might not.
but i can certainly give it an occasional thought
how could i come nearer the goal.
</p>

<p>
doing it every 4 months means 3 reflection points in a year.
i find that not too frequent and not too rare:
it&apos;s just 4 questions that need single sentence answer after all.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll be able to tell if this is valuable or not
after i did it a few times and have some historical data.
so maybe after a year or two i&apos;ll know.
it&apos;s a cheap experiment to try.
