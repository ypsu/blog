<h2 id="news">news</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>ideas about relevant newsletters.</p>
<p>
i don&apos;t really follow news and newsletters.
the stoic wisdom says &quot;focus on things you can control&quot;.
well, news is full of things i can&apos;t control.
it contains mostly unactionable passages that makes me angry and depressed.
it also make me distracted and i focus less on things i actually want to achieve.
</p>

<p>
i can imagine a relevant newsletter for me though.
it would be very local:
it would be made and involve people and places i interact with daily
(e.g. my team and workplace, a sport club and its arena, a neighborhood and its street,
a group of friends and their favorite pub).
i&apos;m imagining a monthly newsletter with topics like this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  a short interview with a peer so that i get to know someone more;
</li><li>
  a short summary of a peer&apos;s work or hobby;
</li><li>
  a free form poll or two about some upcoming fun event, or some other change;
</li><li>
  one line summary of the past month or their current mood from each peer;
</li><li>
  any soapbox writing, tips and tricks written by a peer;
</li><li>
  summary of any relevant upcoming events and changes around the team;
</li><li>
  a selection of gossips and best quotes made by the peers;
</li><li>
  anonymous messages in case people want to whistleblow or point out uncool stuff without their name.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
not all of the above must be present in an instance of the newsletter.
just a few is enough.
the whole thing should be short.
it should fit on a page or two
so that i can skim it through quickly.
the goal of such a newsletter wouldn&apos;t be to fully inform people.
it should be to raise awareness and interest about my peers.
and since they are my peers,
i can freely ask them in person about their short snippet from the newsletter.
this means that the snippets are somewhat actionable for me.
it gives the people relevant topics to chat about.
such a newsletter probably doesn&apos;t make sense below 5 people
and above a dozen people it starts getting irrelevant.
it should be put together by the same person all the time so that quality remains constant.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand i can see that such newsletter might require lot of time investment
and thus might not worth it.
maybe it might make sense only when the team morale or cohesion is low.
a team in such scenario could commit to make 6 issues (e.g. 1 per month for half a year)
and then see if people find it useful or not.
in case there&apos;s a newsletter already and if one doesn&apos;t find it too relevant,
maybe one could ask the writers to include more items like the above.
at least now i think i know what to ask for
whenever someone tries to start a newsletter around me.
</p>

<h2 id="ffpoll">ffpoll</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>free form poll results are more usable.</p>
<p>
how do you poll people?
the typical form i see is this:
</p>

<pre>
  do you want x?
</pre>

<pre>
  [ ] yes
  [ ] no
</pre>

<pre>
  some other question?
</pre>

<pre>
  [ ] option 1
  [ ] option 2
  [ ] option 3
</pre>

<p>
and you are expected to put a cross next to your answer.
the whole thing is then very easy to summarize.
but i think the result is often quite puzzling
because nobody understands why people voted the way they voted.
</p>

<p>
i prefer this form:
</p>

<pre>
  do you want x?
</pre>

<pre>
  -          yes because: ________
  -           no because: ________
  - alternative proposal: ________
</pre>

<pre>
  some other question?
</pre>

<pre>
  -     option 1 because: ________
  -     option 2 because: ________
  -     option 3 because: ________
  - alternative proposal: ________
</pre>

<p>
in this form you are giving free form responses.
you can still just put an x down next to the option you want
in case you don&apos;t want to expand your rationale.
so this form is also easy to summarize.
but people often do want to express nuance
and this manages to capture that.
this lets pollsters better understand why people voted the way they voted.
the result is then hopefully less of a mystery.
make sure to publish the free form text too
not just the absolute number of responses
(perhaps with some editorialization if some responses can&apos;t be published).
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m also fan of the alternative proposal line
because i don&apos;t like forcing people into false dilemmas.
it gives a way for people to explain their reason for abstaining.
and sometimes you might find a good alternative solution with it.
</p>

<p>
note that this has some limitations.
if a person chooses to give a rationale,
you might be able to identify said person even if the form was anonymous.
and such deliberate voting can take a lot of time.
so it mostly works for polls where anonymity is not important
and there&apos;s no time pressure.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t have much experience with this
but i&apos;m hoping that this gets more popular over time.
if it doesn&apos;t really work, i guess i&apos;ll try to make peace with the simple form.
</p>

<h2 id="cmv">cmv</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>r/changemyview is a pretty safe corner in the harsh internet.</p>
<p>
https://reddit.com/r/changemyview is a heavily moderated forum with strict rules
that try to maintain civility in very sensitive topics.
usually such topics go crazy very quickly on a typical internet forum
but this doesn&apos;t seem to plague this forum.
</p>

<p>
the idea is that someone posts some view they harbor
and the commenters will try to convince the author of the opposite,
or at least have the author learn more nuance about the issues.
funny comments, agreeing with the author, rudeness gets all removed
so the thread stays very much focused on the author&apos;s view.
</p>

<p>
and the whole thing is gamified.
whenever the author acknowledges that they have shifted their view
or gained a more nuanced view about their issue thanks to a comment,
they have to give that comment a &quot;delta&quot;.
basically they have to include &quot;!delta&quot; or &quot;Î”&quot; in their response.
a bot then counts the delta points over the whole subreddit
and displays the accumulated delta points next to each username.
it&apos;s probably a nice feeling to get rewarded with such a point
and that might keep people engaged in the discussions.
</p>

<p>
the delta system also helps researchers to understand
what makes some comments more persuasive than others.
here&apos;s one academic&apos;s research site about this.
note specifically the media coverage section:
https://chenhaot.com/pages/changemyview.html.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve tried posting some of my crazy views to see what happens:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /uppercase: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/oaqzcz/cmv_writing_doesnt_inherently_need_uppercase
</li><li>
  /binding: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o0z5jj/cmv_books_should_be_wirebound/
</li><li>
  /intmon: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ofdnn1/cmv_a_copyrightpatentipfree_world_is_nicer/
</li>
</ul>

<p>
although the discourse remains relatively civil,
the whole thing is quite overwhelming.
for one, there&apos;s a lot of repetition
since most commenters don&apos;t seem to read the other comment threads.
and some commenters seem still quite mean even if they are within all the rules
which can make responding to the commenters quite exhausting emotionally.
</p>

<p>
and then i quickly learn that most issues can be broken down into smaller issues
that need to be discussed separately.
discussing everything in one big thread can get confusing.
e.g. when i wanted to argue about the usage of uppercase letters,
i could break that down into capitalization of sentence beginnings
and the capitalization of names.
those must be argued completely differently.
</p>

<p>
and it&apos;s incredibly time consuming.
understanding your opponents&apos; arguments,
preparing a detailed but short response is not trivial.
i think such discussions can&apos;t happen on a very short timeframe.
while i gained a bit of nuance during the discussions,
they didn&apos;t fundamentally change my views.
i feel i&apos;d need to invest more time into the whole thing for that to happen,
not just the few hours i reserved to test the site.
</p>

<p>
and i felt quite disconnected from my opponents:
i didn&apos;t feel i understand them, and i didn&apos;t feel they understand me either.
i think anonymous forums are not for me.
i prefer to know my opponent personally, i think that can make the communication more effective.
i think i&apos;d prefer to be paired with a single person to discuss an issue over months
and maybe then present a shared document that contains our agreement
rather than arguing with a dozen people at the same time.
reddit doesn&apos;t really have a good way to present long back&amp;forth discussions anyways.
</p>

<p>
while i probably won&apos;t be posting much to r/changemyview,
it&apos;s definitely a site where i can look up discussions about almost any topic.
all i need to do is to append &quot;site:reddit.com/r/changemyview&quot; into my search query.
i recommend anyone fancying online discussions to explore this site too.
</p>

<h2 id="intmon">intmon</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>no to intellectual monopoly!</p>
<p>
by intellectual monopoly (intmon) i mean a government mandated monopoly for specific ideas or creations.
i mean mostly copyright and patents.
trademarks are fine since they are for protecting specific identities
so that the consumers can trust the actual product.
</p>

<p>
abolishing them has lot of upsides: more content and products, lower prices, etc.
you can easily mix and match content and share it with everyone without repercussions.
you can freely invent new things and not worry about patent trolls pestering you.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand intmon seems one of those things
that people simply cannot imagine life without.
but i&apos;m quite convinced that if it wouldn&apos;t exist and you wanted to introduce it,
it would be met with huge resistance.
in an intmon-free world completely different business models would have emerged.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  copyright
</p>

<p>
in the copyright case i&apos;d expect people wouldn&apos;t be selling the actual content
but rather their self and their brand.
this is already happening with youtube creators.
they are not selling their videos, those are free.
if they have a large number of subscribers (high influence)
they sell that to sponsors by mentioning their products in their video.
and most of them do this in a sensible manner:
they review the product themselves
which actually makes me want to watch through their sponsored section.
it&apos;s not the insensitive random annoying ads that the internet is full of.
</p>

<p>
lot of book authors these days have a blog with large following.
they could publish their writing there first
and once they have enough content,
they could bind it into a big book.
or if they have a popular book already,
they could be touring and talking about it with people
like how musicians tour and give concerts.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d expect more demand for customized content:
what if a vocal group really likes a fanfic of a popular tv show?
now small scale studios can create that on demand.
and if people can get their wishes created rather than choosing from a selection,
i&apos;d expect people would be happier with the content,
and pay even more, further exacerbating the demand.
perhaps content would be paid beforehand rather than after like it&apos;s done currently.
</p>

<p>
and in case of copyright i acknowledge that there would be less aaa games and movies
because big studios couldn&apos;t justify spending millions in creating something
that will be free in the end.
but i think that&apos;s fine.
those millions of moneys and human hours saved can go to more useful things
like research, infrastructure maintenance or humanitarian causes.
</p>

<p style=font-weight:bold>
  patents
</p>

<p>
on the patent side the most common counterargument is about the research.
who will do the research if not big companies who do it in exchange for patents?
drug companies are the most common example
where a drug needs lots of millions of dollars to develop
but very easy to produce once the r&amp;d is done
so the r&amp;d company needs some protection to recoup costs.
</p>

<p>
but this assumes that it&apos;s companies who need to do this complex research.
academia has not even a chance because these companies poach all the researchers from it.
i&apos;d expect that without patents maybe drug companies wouldn&apos;t invest that much into research
but rather they would fund academia where researchers could now stay and earn good pay.
and because academia is open and independent,
a global community could work on the more important things
rather than drug companies developing yet another antidepressant drug.
but it&apos;s hard to tell what would happen
but i&apos;m quite convinced that research would still happen,
researchers wouldn&apos;t disappear into thin air.
</p>

<p>
another argument is that lack of patents encourage secrecy and complexity to maintain the secrecy.
but what companies can keep a secret today, they already keep that as a secret.
patents are used mostly for easily reverse-engineered or replicated products.
sure, it&apos;s a risk that the r&amp;d develops something easily replicable.
if a company doesn&apos;t like that risk, maybe it shouldn&apos;t do such r&amp;d in the first place.
i don&apos;t find it a compelling reason that private r&amp;d should be rewarded like that.
i&apos;d rather see more open research done in the academia instead
and ensure that any r&amp;d fruits can be immediately enjoyed by everyone at the lowest cost.
</p>

  other thoughts
</p>

<p>
for reference i&apos;ve run this idea through r/changemyview:
https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ofdnn1/cmv_a_copyrightpatentipfree_world_is_nicer/.
it didn&apos;t really make any change in my views.
most commenters assumed that we would continue to use the current business models in the intmon-free world
and then explain how that wouldn&apos;t work (&quot;people would just steal your work and sell it cheaper&quot;).
well duh.
that&apos;s not what i&apos;m arguing here.
i couldn&apos;t really get into the details
because discussions on r/changemyview are incredibly exhausting.
i&apos;d probably need to divide my views into subpoints:
lack of aaa content, no drug patents, secrecy, etc.
but i&apos;d expect discussing even the subpoints would be exhausting.
i&apos;ll expand my thoughts about r/changemyview in general in an upcoming post.
</p>

<p>
in practice, while i respect the right of others,
i assume any of my output is public domain.
i don&apos;t really care how people use it.
but i&apos;m not producing any meaningful content really so it doesn&apos;t really matter anyways.
</p>

<p>
edit: note to myself to ask this question next time i&apos;m discussing this topic:
what&apos;s the difference between &quot;roads&quot; and &quot;drug research&quot;?
why is that &quot;roads can be provided only by the government&quot;
while &quot;drug research can be provided only by private companies&quot;?
