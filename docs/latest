<h2 id="seennet">seennet</h2>
<p>
i think i like the idea of having community sites with very specific rules.
so here&apos;s one idea that i think is optimized for &quot;meeting&quot; people.
by &quot;meeting&quot; i mean a 10 minute-ish videocall.
this would be a social networking site
where you could interact with others only through videocalls.
</p>

<p>
there are sites like omegle and chatroulette
where you can talk with strangers.
the problem with them is
that you don&apos;t really control what happens after the chat:
you might feel the whole chat was in vain
when a good call ended before exchanging contact data.
</p>

<p>
in seennet you can access a person&apos;s profile only after you&apos;ve met them
and as long as both parties agree to this in a short post-call survey.
after getting the consent from both sides, you would become &quot;friends&quot;.
you would have to regularly meet to maintain the relationship
otherwise seennet would break the connection (e.g. after 18 months).
</p>

<p>
in order to use the site, all you need to configure are the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  your availability for scheduling the meeting events (e.g. mornings),
</li><li>
  your language filters (e.g. you only speak english and german),
</li><li>
  optional geographical filters (e.g. only local people).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
then you would ask seennet to schedule you some videocalls.
</p>

<p>
simply chatting randomly could be boring and pointless.
therefore i&apos;d add a little gamification to all this:
another goal on the site would be to &quot;suggest arrangements&quot;.
suppose you know quite a lot of people
and you know a friend of yours would get along
with another friend of yours very well but they don&apos;t know each other yet.
then you enter this suggestion into the system along with a note
that explains why they might like each other
(e.g. you can mention that they both have the same secret hobby).
then if seennet ever schedules a meeting for them
they both see your note before the meeting
so they know that they have a common friend.
that means they are not so stranger after all
and given the recommendation they have a good chance for connecting well.
</p>

<p>
you could compare this system with online dating sites.
there you create an online profile, add photos, list interests.
then you need to message a lot of people
or hope that the right person messages you.
if you are introvert who is into introverts
then the latter strategy might never connect you up with the ideal partner.
you have to invest a lot of energy into this system.
in seennet you simply need to show up regularly
and after a while you&apos;ll start meeting more like minded people
without any reliance on any fancy algorithm doing the right thing.
</p>

<p>
in those dating sites a lot can matter on your profile.
in seennet you re-present your profile every time you meet a new person.
the first few minutes of your introduction is your &quot;profile&quot;, basically.
the nice thing about this is that your live &quot;profile&quot; can improve over time
because you get constant feedback about it
as you see the other people&apos;s reactions.
you might not be so keen on improving your profile page
simply because you have no idea what effect it has on people.
</p>

<p>
i think this sort of thing could bring together people with many interests
not just romantic partners.
maybe you are into learning german.
every time you introduce yourself,
you also tell people that you want to practice german.
maybe the other person knows someone who also studies german.
they can then add a recommendation with a note like this:
&quot;you both like hiking, want to practice german. you should meet!&quot;.
i think there&apos;s less awkwardness with this sort of introductions
compared to a meeting with a complete stranger.
here at least a friend vouched for the other person,
so you should be a bit of at an ease here.
and you also have a common topic already,
no need to spend a lot of time trying to find it.
</p>

<p>
another weird example could be nudity.
i think it was quite common on chatroulette in its early times
and it was usually unwanted by most people.
on seennet you would initially appear on the calls clothed
but you would mention that you like nude calls.
(being clothed in the random calls could be a rule).
if a person knows two people who like being nude
they can arrange a call between them
and the suggestion note could say:
&quot;you both want to be nude. have a nude chat!&quot;.
then you would have the opportunity to go wild with strangers.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s another psychological aspect here:
you can express your weird wishes in an indirect way.
in a traditional site with direct connections only
you would mostly only experience rejection
since the goal is to connect to the other matched person directly.
but in seennet your only goal is to listen and note the desires
so that you can connect people together.
i think the fear of rejection would diminish on a site like this
since the other person doesn&apos;t really have to like you
in order to still rake in virtual points for successful matching.
</p>

<p>
i think the underlying idea behind seennet is very generic
and can easily adapt to a wider range of interests
than what typical sites usually have.
for instance maybe you are a couple
and looking for another couple to play boardgames (or other fun).
</p>

<p>
you could easily register a &quot;couple&quot; profile
and appear as a couple on all videocalls.
solo people might mention this couple in their other calls
and if there are other people who are interested in some couple fun
they could then also register as a couple.
that solo person can then arrange a meeting between them.
in fact a couple based subculture might appear on the site
even without any specialcasing done on the site itself.
</p>

<p>
i wouldn&apos;t allow any messaging on this platform, only videocalls.
if you want messaging, just connect on some other platform.
i think this limitation would keep things simpler and cleaner.
</p>

<p>
but what would motivate members to keep suggesting connections?
i&apos;d make things a bit more complicated for this.
you&apos;ll see when somebody suggests you a connection
but this in itself won&apos;t increase the odds
that seennet schedules the suggested meeting for you.
in order for it to do that you&apos;d need to &quot;accept&quot; the suggestion.
that would increase the odds
that seennet schedules its random calls with that person.
simply increasing the odds i think is a good defense against spam suggestions.
however if the other side also accepts the suggestion
seennet pretty much immediately schedules the meeting
or tells you that you have a calendar mismatch.
</p>

<p>
the trick is in the &quot;accepting&quot;.
you can&apos;t accept a connection unless you suggest one before.
so basically the site has a currency.
you get credit for suggesting.
maybe also for someone accepting your suggestions.
and accepting suggestions uses up such credit.
to limit spam, i&apos;d only allow suggesting one connection per day.
</p>

<p>
the assumption i&apos;m making here is
that people would feel a strong urge to accept suggestions
since that&apos;s how they can find nice friends.
and this urge will then drive them to suggest connections for others.
</p>

<p>
given that you can only establish new connections
through the random or suggested calls,
one would be quite invested into their profile.
creating a new profile wouldn&apos;t give you much
since it would take a while to build up a larger network
that you could spam effectively.
so i think the spam would be somewhat reduced on the site intrinsically.
people would be motivated to adhere to the rules
otherwise they have a lot to lose (i.e. their network).
</p>

<p>
another benefit of using such a site is
that it takes control of &quot;maintaining&quot; the connections.
i&apos;m really bad at this in real life:
if somebody doesn&apos;t call or write to me then i don&apos;t reach out to them.
for one, i feel shy and feel that i would be disturbing them
if i asked how are things with them.
two, i know that such talking usually starts at and often ends at small talk.
and i&apos;m really bad and uncomfortable at small talk
so i simply avoid it if i can.
but if some entity randomly schedules some videocalls 
then it might help me take care of the anxieties
and the scheduling work around this.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve chosen short online videocalls
because they can fit the modern schedule easier
and give access to many people very conveniently.
i&apos;m sure such things exist in offline world too:
e.g. i think there are apps that arrange lunch mates for you
so you don&apos;t have to eat alone.
in such places arranging dates with others might come less naturally
so that&apos;s why a little gamified site around this could help.
also, lunching can be expensive from both time and money perspective,
hence i think i&apos;d prefer the low cost videocalls.
but i still would want to do it with local people
and that&apos;s why i&apos;d add the option for geographic filtering into the settings.
</p>

<p>
i came to this peer powered matchmaking site idea
while reading fowler&apos;s book called &quot;connected&quot;.
that book talks about social networks/graphs in general.
i really liked the &quot;friend of a friend&quot; aspect:
the number of people you are connected through a friend is quite large.
and your friend often connects you to another of their friend
if they seem that such a friendship would be beneficial.
in fact, this is how a lot of romantic relationships get arranged.
so then i thought how could one build a network around this
and maybe nudge people a little bit to be more active in suggesting.
the above is what i came up with.
</p>

<p>
and these days it&apos;s pretty easy to set up videocalls between people
using all the browser apis.
so i think the implementation of such a site would be relatively simple.
although i&apos;m somewhat unsure if peer-to-peer videocalls should be allowed
or if the videocalls should go through a central server.
i don&apos;t know how bad it is to leak ip addresses these days.
alternatively i&apos;m sure one could use jitsi for this one way or another.
</p>

<p>
if such a site would exist, i might try it.
maybe one day in my distant retirement i might build it
if i still want it and it doesn&apos;t exist yet.
</p>

<h2 id="reflecting">reflecting</h2>
<p>
one thought stuck with me from my previous post, /grow.
in there i propose that one should occasionally write answers to 4 questions.
to recap, let me list those 4 questions along with a single word
that summarizes the question&apos;s intent:
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement:
  what achievement of yours are you the most proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  failure: what are you not so proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  goal: name a goal for the next few months.
</li><li>
  peers: name a few people who you interacted with a lot in the past few months.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think these are pretty good questions:
they don&apos;t overwhelm you because they only ask you to list one answer.
even answering with one short sentence is enough.
and just because you list at least one answer,
it already bumps you out of a fully autopilot life.
</p>

<p>
in that post i suggest
that people work on these questions regularly with a mentor.
however what if someone doesn&apos;t have a mentor?
well, i think one should still ask those questions from themselves regularly.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll give it a shot every 4 months or so.
i tried answering those questions and they are not that easy.
as an example here&apos;s what i came up with yesterday after some pondering
(keep in mind that the answers are about the surrounding +/- 4 months):
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement: i&apos;ve created a good daily routine.
</li><li>
  failure: i still distracted myself too often with pointless internet surfing.
</li><li>
  goal: find an accountability partner to grow my peer list.
</li><li>
  peers: my wife only.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it took me a while to answer those questions
but now i feel i have a bit more clarity about where i am and where am i going.
although i&apos;ll try to do this regularly but probably i won&apos;t do it publicly.
i feel doing it publicly would prevent being fully honest with the answers.
the answers could often require a lot of personal context
that would just not make sense without that extra knowledge.
e.g. my &quot;goal&quot; has more nuance to it that i didn&apos;t elaborate above.
or one might not want to publicize their failures and aspirations.
though i might change my mind and i&apos;ll just keep updating this post
or add a new post for every reflection point even if things don&apos;t make sense.
</p>

<p>
note that this reflection doesn&apos;t necessary come with any commitments.
for instance i can now decide
how disturbing the procrastination mentioned in the failure question is.
if it is, i might start tracking it or try to prevent it.
or i might just make a mental note of it (raise mental awareness)
and see how it changes over time.
furthermore, i might make plans to achieve my goal or i might not.
but i can certainly give it an occasional thought
how could i come nearer the goal.
</p>

<p>
doing it every 4 months means 3 reflection points in a year.
i find that not too frequent and not too rare:
it&apos;s just 4 questions that need single sentence answer after all.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll be able to tell if this is valuable or not
after i did it a few times and have some historical data.
so maybe after a year or two i&apos;ll know.
it&apos;s a cheap experiment to try.
</p>

<h2 id="grow">grow</h2>
<p>
i feel that there&apos;s still a lot of undereducation, even illiteracy in places
where things should really be much better.
it seems to me that there are people
who are not that interested in education and the more civilized way of life
which in turn leads to another generation of theirs with the same qualities.
often these people have completely different culture and lifestyle
compared to the traditional western people.
the traditional education experience simply doesn&apos;t work for them
which is a loss for both them and everyone else in the society.
</p>

<p>
by &quot;traditional education&quot; i mean something where kids go to school,
passively learn a fixed curriculum for about 6 hours a day
(they sit at their little desks and listen to the teacher all day long),
and then get examined and so on.
people then keep repeating classes until they get a passing grade,
or get bored of the school and simply don&apos;t go anymore.
usually such classes contain a lot of people
which causes problems around managing the classroom
and around the boredom and the pacing of the material.
</p>

<p>
every person develops at a different pace, has different interests,
needs different environment for effective learning,
needs different psychological support to make sense of the world.
i think the traditional one size for all system
doesn&apos;t really scale well to diverse groups.
</p>

<p>
we also need to acknowledge that not everyone wants to be a doctor,
engineer, professor, or something other that needs high education.
some people just want to stay at home (e.g. to raise kids)
or just have some simple non-demanding job that allows them a comfortable life.
given the technological prowess the world has,
it should probably be fine to not work at all.
</p>

<p>
i think the only things that everyone should know are the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  reading
</li><li>
  writing (both handwriting and typing on the computer)
</li><li>
  basic math skills (e.g. addition so that they can work with money)
</li><li>
  how to ask for help (e.g. googling, going to doctors, speaking up)
</li><li>
  purpose and techniques of learning, science and life in general
</li><li>
  ethics, courtesy and some other basic life and social skills
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think that&apos;s about it what we should universally expect from all the people.
anything on top of that should be at the person&apos;s own discretion.
most of the above cannot be tested with standardized tests.
(standardized tests are dumb on many levels but i don&apos;t want to get into that.)
in fact there&apos;s no standardized way to teach all of the above,
each person would need unique attention over many years
to ensure achieving all of the above.
</p>

<p>
in order to achieve that, i think each kid needs a mentor
who will appropriately challenge the kid and ensure their growth.
we usually expect that the teachers do this for us
but that doesn&apos;t really scale for most schools.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d make &quot;mentor&quot; an officially acknowledged title that people can wear.
and i&apos;d allow anyone to become a mentor after some short training.
so if you are a bored stay at home mom,
then you could sign up to mentor a few kids around the block
(you could mentor your own kids but if the kids have a problem with you
then you are robbing them from a truly 3rd party, neutral help.)
</p>

<p>
the mentor&apos;s task would be to ensure regular reflection in people.
one can even formalize this.
i&apos;d expect that the mentor and the mentee would create a document together
on a regular timeframe (no more than 5 months)
that has a short answer to these prompts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  what achievement of yours are you the most proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  what are you not so proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  name a goal for the next few months.
</li><li>
  name a few people who you interacted with a lot in the past few months.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
even a sentence&apos;s worth of answer is enough.
the point here is to ask the question so that it triggers the reflection.
this can prevent people going on autopilot all the time.
</p>

<p>
the last prompt about other people is for the mentor
to solicit feedback about the mentee from other people
at their own leisure time.
this is to ensure that the various bubble and bias effects are somewhat smaller.
</p>

<p>
the answers to these questions would be relatively private.
however to ensure accountability,
the mentors would need to occasionally report to some mentor managers.
these managers would be well experienced mentors
that know what to look for and how to improve mentoring
so they would review these answers for their reports.
this means the mentor&apos;s manager would also have access to the answers.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d mandate everyone to have a mentor
and to have such reflection documents written regularly.
the nice thing about anybody easily becoming a mentor is
that each mentee can then easily find a culturally similar mentor
who has then a much higher chance to really connect with the mentee.
(one of the ongoing expectations of the mentors would be
to find a better mentor for the mentee if possible.
mentor managers could help a lot with this.)
</p>

<p>
the mentor and mentees would regularly meet (e.g. weekly even).
it doesn&apos;t have to be a formal meeting.
they might go for a walk, coffee, gym, videogame arcade,
whatever that really makes it easy to talk for the people.
mentee would then tell about their ongoing struggles
and the mentor would then challenge the mentee to overcome them
and perhaps intervene or help out if the mentee has too large problems.
the mentor can also suggest new things to try
if the mentee is not sure what to do.
</p>

<p>
such mentorship shouldn&apos;t necessarily end at 18 years old.
in fact this should be a lifelong thing.
each citizen should have access to a neutral mentor
(so ideally somebody with whom you have no conflict of interest with any topic).
i&apos;m not saying this should be mandatory, just a civil right.
i mean government (or something) should ensure an active network
of freely available mentors for consultation.
stuff like this might already exists (e.g. in the form of self organized groups)
but it can be quite hard to find and consider such things
if you had never been exposed to such things before
(and this is why i&apos;d make it mandatory for teenagers at least).
</p>

<p>
now back to education.
thanks to all the technological advancements
a lot of new options have opened up when it comes to education.
for instance we no longer need traditional lectures.
people wanting lectures can just watch videos on the internet instead.
and some of those videos (e.g. khan academy stuff)
is much better quality than your average teacher could ever do
whilst trying to maintain order in a classroom.
learners can pause, rewind, alter the speed of such videos
which makes it much easier to follow the content.
</p>

<p>
this doesn&apos;t eliminate the classrooms though.
i think classrooms are still good for practicing together,
asking questions, clearing up uncertainties about a certain topic.
sometimes you don&apos;t even need a teacher,
a group of similarly interested students can just get together
and help each other understand some study materials.
</p>

<p>
so this means that schools would continue to exist
and students can go there to learn all sorts of things.
but what you learn there is mostly up to you.
it is your mentor who nudges you to pick up interesting stuff
and some stuff outside from your comfort zone too.
it should be fine to not study anything
and just play table tennis or to wrestle with others all day long too.
the important point here is to ensure everyone can find something here
that can occupy them rather than leaving people unsupervised
and then having them go on some antisocial rampage.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d imagine that such schools could start when the kids become teenagers
and until that time
a somewhat less organized kindergarten like environment would be enough.
however smarter kids could easily go earlier to a school like that
if they feel like ready.
i wouldn&apos;t put an upper age limit how long can people stay there.
it should be possible even for adults to go back and learn with kids
if they wish so.
not sure how weird that would be.
</p>

<p>
i wouldn&apos;t give mandatory tests to the kids here.
however it should be possible for the kids to have 1:1s with the teachers
where the teacher tries to figure out the weaknesses of the kid.
this wouldn&apos;t be graded and it would be solely for the kid&apos;s own development.
</p>

<p>
i think all sorts of kids could thrive here.
the smart kid who simply soaks everything could just take all the modules.
the one kid who has interest in one topic only and zones out on everything else
can just learn that single topic and perhaps occasionally read about
or listen to other topics on a mentor&apos;s prompt.
the student who has no interest in learning or is antisocial:
such kids usually don&apos;t thrive in traditional schools.
at least in a place like this they might slowly learn to control their impulses
if nothing else rather than let them develop uncontrollably.
</p>

<p>
in the old days teachers could simply use physical force
to intimidate people into compliance.
this might have given the illusion that schools worked better in the past.
students these days know their rights very much
so teachers need more subtle ways to make the school a nice place.
i think people just need real good, personal guidance
and that&apos;s why i talked so much about mentoring above.
</p>

<p>
i think schools like this already exist
even with some mentoring (e.g. budapest school, i believe)
but they aren&apos;t very mainstream.
but i think all schools will slowly evolve in this direction over time.
kids these days can already take lectures from internet.
lectures can become the &quot;homework&quot;
and classrooms can become more interactive practice or discussions groups
if they haven&apos;t already.
thanks to all instantaneous communication, calendar and scheduling software
a school can decide for more flexible classroom schedules
so kids can have more freedom to rearrange their week as they see fit.
there&apos;s no need to centrally plan it all.
this also opens up possibilties for the schools to provide more optional courses
and kids can then focus more on their areas of interest.
</p>

<p>
in general i&apos;m quite optimistic about the education in the future.
but i expect the above changes will come only after a generation or two:
the world is different than what it was when i grew up.
to fully embrace it, i think you need people who were grown up in it.
that&apos;s why i expect that all we need to do is to wait
until the today&apos;s younglings start leading schools in the future.
</p>

<h2 id="optioning">optioning</h2>
<p>
i&apos;m really bad in conversations.
in real life i tend to be too silent and superficial.
in emails i tend to write too much, sometimes being too insensitive.
i&apos;m pretty sure i often overwhelm the recipient with the quantity
because i often don&apos;t get any replies.
and my writing style is not very coherent,
i just keep rambling about random stuff.
reading my writing is probably quite hard.
and often people don&apos;t even like to write,
so then i&apos;m having hard time to communicate with such people.
</p>

<p>
i think there are two big problems with my art of communication.
the quantity problem: i&apos;m tempted to ask too many questions.
it&apos;s pretty much infeasible to answer them all in one message.
and even if you were able to do, you have to go question by question
which makes the email to have a very unnatural format.
</p>

<p>
then there&apos;s the quality problem:
some of the questions are very hard, that nobody knows the answers to.
the recipient has no idea how to respond to such a question,
and as such is very discouraged from responding at all.
</p>

<p>
i think i found a way to address both issues.
rather than asking all the questions in one letter,
i focus on asking a single question.
if i have more, then i might start tracking the list of questions or topics
that needs further discourse, and simply ask them at a later point.
furthermore i also provide 2-4 answer options
and the recipient simply must choose the least wrong answer
with an optional comment.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t think one needs to obsess about the answer quality
since the expectation is to choose the least wrong.
i&apos;d expect people would mention a better answer if they have in the comment.
the point is to force people to make a decision.
in case of indecisive people
you can pretty much bypass the indecisive consciousness
and get an answer right from the subconsciousness.
for your email partner the whole thing is like
one of those conversational adventure games
(e.g. telltale&apos;s walking dead or life is strange).
</p>

<p>
however the downside is that this is much harder on the questioner.
they really need to think a lot what single question would be the one
that uncovers the most information for them about the other person.
it&apos;s an intriguing puzzle game.
it&apos;s somewhat similar to debugging computer programs.
but here you are debugging humans.
you create several hypotheses
and the other person tells you which one is the closest.
or it&apos;s like that &quot;hot and cold&quot; kid game
where you hide something and the kid has to find it
with you converting their distance from it into temperatures.
</p>

<p>
(edit: to generate good answers,
the questioner needs to put themselves in to the answerer&apos;s shoes.
they questioner must see the question from the answerer&apos;s perspective.
i think this can bring a lot of clarity to the questioner,
and thus gives a big boost to feeling empathetic to the other person.)
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s a very slow process but if one has patience
and the other person is willing to play this honestly,
i think one can learn quite a lot of deep things about the other person.
and it&apos;s very easy to start.
you start with something like &quot;how are you these days? good/bad&quot;
and then the rest of the questions sort of give themselves.
e.g. &quot;what makes you happy/sad these days?&quot; for the above one.
if unsure, you can always ask &quot;why?&quot; for the previous answer
and try to come up with some realistic answers to it.
</p>

<p>
i think it&apos;s important to play this over email rather than instant messaging.
sometimes it might take several days
to come up with the next question or even with the answer.
email supports labeling and threading by default
so it&apos;s the best medium for slow communication.
</p>

<p>
such a discussion could be almost neverending.
however given the fact that one could go at it very slowly,
that shouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem.
one could easily talk like that with multiple people
if they are not bothered by the fact that the delays
between the individual messages with a given person will keep growing.
also, if you have lots of questions that you want to ask a single person,
you could have multiple parallel threads with them.
though i&apos;d expect that could be quite strenuous to maintain.
</p>

<p>
to give a small taste how this could look like,
i&apos;ve created a demo about this at /dialog.
it&apos;s just a dumb dialog tree.
it obviously cannot have as much nuance as a realtime conversation could have.
but it was quite fun to write it.
it was quite tiring to write it though so therefore it&apos;s very short.
</p>

<p>
btw, this idea could take many other forms.
for instance that dialog tree from above could be a collaboratively edited one,
implemented similarly like a wiki.
that way it could grow quite big.
with some sort of trusted peer review it could stay quite sensible.
or one could make an app for it,
that keeps asking you questions very slowly.
and then its developer just keep adding new nodes based on the stats
where the most people are stuck currently.
the developer&apos;s goal would be
to split people along the nodes as much as possible.
or maybe one could make a live tv interview show
where the host comes up with good questions
that both the viewers and the interviewee tries to answer.
first the interviewee tries to guess the viewers response,
and then analyze those results.
i think this could give a good insight how someone thinks
since they have to put themselves into other people&apos;s shoes.
the socractic method has similarities to this method too.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m not sure what the name of this technique would be.
i went with &quot;optioning&quot;
since the primary task is to give options to the other person.
</p>

<p>
anyways, at least i now have a new technique in my toolset,
maybe i&apos;ll use it one day too.
