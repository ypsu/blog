<h2 id="reflecting">reflecting</h2>
<p>
one thought stuck with me from my previous post, /grow.
in there i propose that one should occasionally write answers to 4 questions.
to recap, let me list those 4 questions along with a single word
that summarizes the question&apos;s intent:
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement:
  what achievement of yours are you the most proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  failure: what are you not so proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  goal: name a goal for the next few months.
</li><li>
  peers: name a few people who you interacted with a lot in the past few months.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think these are pretty good questions:
they don&apos;t overwhelm you because they only ask you to list one answer.
even answering with one short sentence is enough.
and just because you list at least one answer,
it already bumps you out of a fully autopilot life.
</p>

<p>
in that post i suggest
that people work on these questions regularly with a mentor.
however what if someone doesn&apos;t have a mentor?
well, i think one should still ask those questions from themselves regularly.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll give it a shot every 4 months or so.
i tried answering those questions and they are not that easy.
as an example here&apos;s what i came up with yesterday after some pondering
(keep in mind that the answers are about the surrounding +/- 4 months):
</p>

<ul><li>
  achievement: i&apos;ve created a good daily routine.
</li><li>
  failure: i still distracted myself too often with pointless internet surfing.
</li><li>
  goal: find an accountability partner to grow my peer list.
</li><li>
  peers: my wife only.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it took me a while to answer those questions
but now i feel i have a bit more clarity about where i am and where am i going.
although i&apos;ll try to do this regularly but probably i won&apos;t do it publicly.
i feel doing it publicly would prevent being fully honest with the answers.
the answers could often require a lot of personal context
that would just not make sense without that extra knowledge.
e.g. my &quot;goal&quot; has more nuance to it that i didn&apos;t elaborate above.
or one might not want to publicize their failures and aspirations.
though i might change my mind and i&apos;ll just keep updating this post
or add a new post for every reflection point even if things don&apos;t make sense.
</p>

<p>
note that this reflection doesn&apos;t necessary come with any commitments.
for instance i can now decide
how disturbing the procrastination mentioned in the failure question is.
if it is, i might start tracking it or try to prevent it.
or i might just make a mental note of it (raise mental awareness)
and see how it changes over time.
furthermore, i might make plans to achieve my goal or i might not.
but i can certainly give it an occasional thought
how could i come nearer the goal.
</p>

<p>
doing it every 4 months means 3 reflection points in a year.
i find that not too frequent and not too rare:
it&apos;s just 4 questions that need single sentence answer after all.
</p>

<p>
i think i&apos;ll be able to tell if this is valuable or not
after i did it a few times and have some historical data.
so maybe after a year or two i&apos;ll know.
it&apos;s a cheap experiment to try.
</p>

<h2 id="grow">grow</h2>
<p>
i feel that there&apos;s still a lot of undereducation, even illiteracy in places
where things should really be much better.
it seems to me that there are people
who are not that interested in education and the more civilized way of life
which in turn leads to another generation of theirs with the same qualities.
often these people have completely different culture and lifestyle
compared to the traditional western people.
the traditional education experience simply doesn&apos;t work for them
which is a loss for both them and everyone else in the society.
</p>

<p>
by &quot;traditional education&quot; i mean something where kids go to school,
passively learn a fixed curriculum for about 6 hours a day
(they sit at their little desks and listen to the teacher all day long),
and then get examined and so on.
people then keep repeating classes until they get a passing grade,
or get bored of the school and simply don&apos;t go anymore.
usually such classes contain a lot of people
which causes problems around managing the classroom
and around the boredom and the pacing of the material.
</p>

<p>
every person develops at a different pace, has different interests,
needs different environment for effective learning,
needs different psychological support to make sense of the world.
i think the traditional one size for all system
doesn&apos;t really scale well to diverse groups.
</p>

<p>
we also need to acknowledge that not everyone wants to be a doctor,
engineer, professor, or something other that needs high education.
some people just want to stay at home (e.g. to raise kids)
or just have some simple non-demanding job that allows them a comfortable life.
given the technological prowess the world has,
it should probably be fine to not work at all.
</p>

<p>
i think the only things that everyone should know are the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  reading
</li><li>
  writing (both handwriting and typing on the computer)
</li><li>
  basic math skills (e.g. addition so that they can work with money)
</li><li>
  how to ask for help (e.g. googling, going to doctors, speaking up)
</li><li>
  purpose and techniques of learning, science and life in general
</li><li>
  ethics, courtesy and some other basic life and social skills
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think that&apos;s about it what we should universally expect from all the people.
anything on top of that should be at the person&apos;s own discretion.
most of the above cannot be tested with standardized tests.
(standardized tests are dumb on many levels but i don&apos;t want to get into that.)
in fact there&apos;s no standardized way to teach all of the above,
each person would need unique attention over many years
to ensure achieving all of the above.
</p>

<p>
in order to achieve that, i think each kid needs a mentor
who will appropriately challenge the kid and ensure their growth.
we usually expect that the teachers do this for us
but that doesn&apos;t really scale for most schools.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d make &quot;mentor&quot; an officially acknowledged title that people can wear.
and i&apos;d allow anyone to become a mentor after some short training.
so if you are a bored stay at home mom,
then you could sign up to mentor a few kids around the block
(you could mentor your own kids but if the kids have a problem with you
then you are robbing them from a truly 3rd party, neutral help.)
</p>

<p>
the mentor&apos;s task would be to ensure regular reflection in people.
one can even formalize this.
i&apos;d expect that the mentor and the mentee would create a document together
on a regular timeframe (no more than 5 months)
that has a short answer to these prompts:
</p>

<ul><li>
  what achievement of yours are you the most proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  what are you not so proud of from the past few months?
</li><li>
  name a goal for the next few months.
</li><li>
  name a few people who you interacted with a lot in the past few months.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
even a sentence&apos;s worth of answer is enough.
the point here is to ask the question so that it triggers the reflection.
this can prevent people going on autopilot all the time.
</p>

<p>
the last prompt about other people is for the mentor
to solicit feedback about the mentee from other people
at their own leisure time.
this is to ensure that the various bubble and bias effects are somewhat smaller.
</p>

<p>
the answers to these questions would be relatively private.
however to ensure accountability,
the mentors would need to occasionally report to some mentor managers.
these managers would be well experienced mentors
that know what to look for and how to improve mentoring
so they would review these answers for their reports.
this means the mentor&apos;s manager would also have access to the answers.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d mandate everyone to have a mentor
and to have such reflection documents written regularly.
the nice thing about anybody easily becoming a mentor is
that each mentee can then easily find a culturally similar mentor
who has then a much higher chance to really connect with the mentee.
(one of the ongoing expectations of the mentors would be
to find a better mentor for the mentee if possible.
mentor managers could help a lot with this.)
</p>

<p>
the mentor and mentees would regularly meet (e.g. weekly even).
it doesn&apos;t have to be a formal meeting.
they might go for a walk, coffee, gym, videogame arcade,
whatever that really makes it easy to talk for the people.
mentee would then tell about their ongoing struggles
and the mentor would then challenge the mentee to overcome them
and perhaps intervene or help out if the mentee has too large problems.
the mentor can also suggest new things to try
if the mentee is not sure what to do.
</p>

<p>
such mentorship shouldn&apos;t necessarily end at 18 years old.
in fact this should be a lifelong thing.
each citizen should have access to a neutral mentor
(so ideally somebody with whom you have no conflict of interest with any topic).
i&apos;m not saying this should be mandatory, just a civil right.
i mean government (or something) should ensure an active network
of freely available mentors for consultation.
stuff like this might already exists (e.g. in the form of self organized groups)
but it can be quite hard to find and consider such things
if you had never been exposed to such things before
(and this is why i&apos;d make it mandatory for teenagers at least).
</p>

<p>
now back to education.
thanks to all the technological advancements
a lot of new options have opened up when it comes to education.
for instance we no longer need traditional lectures.
people wanting lectures can just watch videos on the internet instead.
and some of those videos (e.g. khan academy stuff)
is much better quality than your average teacher could ever do
whilst trying to maintain order in a classroom.
learners can pause, rewind, alter the speed of such videos
which makes it much easier to follow the content.
</p>

<p>
this doesn&apos;t eliminate the classrooms though.
i think classrooms are still good for practicing together,
asking questions, clearing up uncertainties about a certain topic.
sometimes you don&apos;t even need a teacher,
a group of similarly interested students can just get together
and help each other understand some study materials.
</p>

<p>
so this means that schools would continue to exist
and students can go there to learn all sorts of things.
but what you learn there is mostly up to you.
it is your mentor who nudges you to pick up interesting stuff
and some stuff outside from your comfort zone too.
it should be fine to not study anything
and just play table tennis or to wrestle with others all day long too.
the important point here is to ensure everyone can find something here
that can occupy them rather than leaving people unsupervised
and then having them go on some antisocial rampage.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;d imagine that such schools could start when the kids become teenagers
and until that time
a somewhat less organized kindergarten like environment would be enough.
however smarter kids could easily go earlier to a school like that
if they feel like ready.
i wouldn&apos;t put an upper age limit how long can people stay there.
it should be possible even for adults to go back and learn with kids
if they wish so.
not sure how weird that would be.
</p>

<p>
i wouldn&apos;t give mandatory tests to the kids here.
however it should be possible for the kids to have 1:1s with the teachers
where the teacher tries to figure out the weaknesses of the kid.
this wouldn&apos;t be graded and it would be solely for the kid&apos;s own development.
</p>

<p>
i think all sorts of kids could thrive here.
the smart kid who simply soaks everything could just take all the modules.
the one kid who has interest in one topic only and zones out on everything else
can just learn that single topic and perhaps occasionally read about
or listen to other topics on a mentor&apos;s prompt.
the student who has no interest in learning or is antisocial:
such kids usually don&apos;t thrive in traditional schools.
at least in a place like this they might slowly learn to control their impulses
if nothing else rather than let them develop uncontrollably.
</p>

<p>
in the old days teachers could simply use physical force
to intimidate people into compliance.
this might have given the illusion that schools worked better in the past.
students these days know their rights very much
so teachers need more subtle ways to make the school a nice place.
i think people just need real good, personal guidance
and that&apos;s why i talked so much about mentoring above.
</p>

<p>
i think schools like this already exist
even with some mentoring (e.g. budapest school, i believe)
but they aren&apos;t very mainstream.
but i think all schools will slowly evolve in this direction over time.
kids these days can already take lectures from internet.
lectures can become the &quot;homework&quot;
and classrooms can become more interactive practice or discussions groups
if they haven&apos;t already.
thanks to all instantaneous communication, calendar and scheduling software
a school can decide for more flexible classroom schedules
so kids can have more freedom to rearrange their week as they see fit.
there&apos;s no need to centrally plan it all.
this also opens up possibilties for the schools to provide more optional courses
and kids can then focus more on their areas of interest.
</p>

<p>
in general i&apos;m quite optimistic about the education in the future.
but i expect the above changes will come only after a generation or two:
the world is different than what it was when i grew up.
to fully embrace it, i think you need people who were grown up in it.
that&apos;s why i expect that all we need to do is to wait
until the today&apos;s younglings start leading schools in the future.
</p>

<h2 id="optioning">optioning</h2>
<p>
i&apos;m really bad in conversations.
in real life i tend to be too silent and superficial.
in emails i tend to write too much, sometimes being too insensitive.
i&apos;m pretty sure i often overwhelm the recipient with the quantity
because i often don&apos;t get any replies.
and my writing style is not very coherent,
i just keep rambling about random stuff.
reading my writing is probably quite hard.
and often people don&apos;t even like to write,
so then i&apos;m having hard time to communicate with such people.
</p>

<p>
i think there are two big problems with my art of communication.
the quantity problem: i&apos;m tempted to ask too many questions.
it&apos;s pretty much infeasible to answer them all in one message.
and even if you were able to do, you have to go question by question
which makes the email to have a very unnatural format.
</p>

<p>
then there&apos;s the quality problem:
some of the questions are very hard, that nobody knows the answers to.
the recipient has no idea how to respond to such a question,
and as such is very discouraged from responding at all.
</p>

<p>
i think i found a way to address both issues.
rather than asking all the questions in one letter,
i focus on asking a single question.
if i have more, then i might start tracking the list of questions or topics
that needs further discourse, and simply ask them at a later point.
furthermore i also provide 2-4 answer options
and the recipient simply must choose the least wrong answer
with an optional comment.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t think one needs to obsess about the answer quality
since the expectation is to choose the least wrong.
i&apos;d expect people would mention a better answer if they have in the comment.
the point is to force people to make a decision.
in case of indecisive people
you can pretty much bypass the indecisive consciousness
and get an answer right from the subconsciousness.
for your email partner the whole thing is like
one of those conversational adventure games
(e.g. telltale&apos;s walking dead or life is strange).
</p>

<p>
however the downside is that this is much harder on the questioner.
they really need to think a lot what single question would be the one
that uncovers the most information for them about the other person.
it&apos;s an intriguing puzzle game.
it&apos;s somewhat similar to debugging computer programs.
but here you are debugging humans.
you create several hypotheses
and the other person tells you which one is the closest.
or it&apos;s like that &quot;hot and cold&quot; kid game
where you hide something and the kid has to find it
with you converting their distance from it into temperatures.
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s a very slow process but if one has patience
and the other person is willing to play this honestly,
i think one can learn quite a lot of deep things about the other person.
and it&apos;s very easy to start.
you start with something like &quot;how are you these days? good/bad&quot;
and then the rest of the questions sort of give themselves.
e.g. &quot;what makes you happy/sad these days?&quot; for the above one.
if unsure, you can always ask &quot;why?&quot; for the previous answer
and try to come up with some realistic answers to it.
</p>

<p>
i think it&apos;s important to play this over email rather than instant messaging.
sometimes it might take several days
to come up with the next question or even with the answer.
email supports labeling and threading by default
so it&apos;s the best medium for slow communication.
</p>

<p>
such a discussion could be almost neverending.
however given the fact that one could go at it very slowly,
that shouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem.
one could easily talk like that with multiple people
if they are not bothered by the fact that the delays
between the individual messages with a given person will keep growing.
also, if you have lots of questions that you want to ask a single person,
you could have multiple parallel threads with them.
though i&apos;d expect that could be quite strenuous to maintain.
</p>

<p>
to give a small taste how this could look like,
i&apos;ve created a demo about this at /dialog.
it&apos;s just a dumb dialog tree.
it obviously cannot have as much nuance as a realtime conversation could have.
but it was quite fun to write it.
it was quite tiring to write it though so therefore it&apos;s very short.
</p>

<p>
btw, this idea could take many other forms.
for instance that dialog tree from above could be a collaboratively edited one,
implemented similarly like a wiki.
that way it could grow quite big.
with some sort of trusted peer review it could stay quite sensible.
or one could make an app for it,
that keeps asking you questions very slowly.
and then its developer just keep adding new nodes based on the stats
where the most people are stuck currently.
the developer&apos;s goal would be
to split people along the nodes as much as possible.
or maybe one could make a live tv interview show
where the host comes up with good questions
that both the viewers and the interviewee tries to answer.
first the interviewee tries to guess the viewers response,
and then analyze those results.
i think this could give a good insight how someone thinks
since they have to put themselves into other people&apos;s shoes.
the socractic method has similarities to this method too.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m not sure what the name of this technique would be.
i went with &quot;optioning&quot;
since the primary task is to give options to the other person.
</p>

<p>
anyways, at least i now have a new technique in my toolset,
maybe i&apos;ll use it one day too.
</p>

<h2 id="typer">typer</h2>
<p>
i don&apos;t usually use laptops, i much prefer the static desktop setups.
but i sometimes i do dream about what my ideal mobile computer would be.
my problem with most modern devices is
that they run these ultracomplicated operating systems
running all sorts of processes on it.
it bothers me because it uses up energy and battery unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
i wish for a machine that could last for weeks or months on a single charge.
ideally something that doesn&apos;t consume any energy if you don&apos;t interact with it.
the kindle is almost like this however it&apos;s screen has a too slow refresh rate
so it&apos;s a bit limited for interactive use.
and besides, even kindle&apos;s system is full of unnecessary stuff.
it runs linux which pretty much means it&apos;s full of unnecessary stuff.
</p>

<p>
my primary usecase for such a device would be writing and text editing.
so i definitely need a good keyboard as well.
phones and tables are out of question.
they have their place though: i think kindle is quite good for reading.
for keyboard it would be nice if it were splittable just like ergodox.
most ideal would be if the two halves could be snapped together to
act as a single keyboard like on ordinary laptops too.
the screen should be detachable too.
it should come with a small tall stand that i could put it on
so that i don&apos;t need to unnecessary hunch to use it
if i have access to a proper desk.
by detachable i don&apos;t mean wireless:
i don&apos;t mind having the screen and the keyboard wired.
</p>

<p>
as for the screen: i don&apos;t need colors.
i think my ideal screen would be those old monochrome lcd screens
that old calculators had.
those lasted quite long on very little battery.
and those worked quite nice in sunlight without any backlight too.
and i don&apos;t need a large resolution.
something like 640x480 or in that range would be more than enough.
hopefully this wouldn&apos;t drain much energy in general.
</p>

<p>
but still, what about the operating system and the cpu?
how could i have a very dumb system
but at the same time still have access to the modern world
of compilers, internet and so on?
i think this laptop needs two chips:
</p>

<ul><li>
  a microcontroller with very low power consumption
  that could run some in memory filesystem and a text editor.
  this microcontroller would run pretty much all the time.
</li><li>
  a full blown mini-computer (e.g. raspberry pi zero w).
  this would be mostly off but i can occassionally turn it on to
  sync my edits to disk, run a compilation and get back the results,
  or simply fetch my email from internet.
  ideally it would also have a 4g modem,
  so that the device would be internet enabled.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i think this dual system could work quite perfectly.
using a dumb microcontroller for the primary interface means
that you can really minimize all the unnecessary stuff to a bare minimum
without needing to deal with the complexities of a full modern system.
and ideally this microcontroller wouldn&apos;t consume lot of energy,
nor would the keyboard or the screen,
so i could easily use this device for a long time.
sure, the text editor would have limited features, but that&apos;s fine.
i don&apos;t even need wrapping support thanks to my semantic break style.
</p>

<p>
i could even code like this.
for instance i&apos;d implement some big function.
then i&apos;d activate the mini computer.
the linux on it would quickly boot up,
write my in-memory edits to disk,
call the compiler and write its error messages back to another in-memory file,
and then simply turn itself off.
now i can fix all those errors one by one
without running the full computer, without draining the battery.
once i&apos;m happy with the changes,
i can turn the machine back on to compile again and
maybe push the changes to, say, github.
ideally the microcontroller would be programmable,
so, for example, i should be able to run a light c syntax checker on it
to save me activating the full computer before i fixed all the dumb errors.
</p>

<p>
even email reading would be quite nice (assuming people do plaintext emails).
the process would be this: turn on the mini computer,
it fetches the emails and writes them to the in-memory fs,
and then it turns itself off.
now i can read them at my pleasure, maybe even prepare some responses.
</p>

<p>
and since the battery could last for weeks
maybe i could go into the woods for a week long fasting retreat
into a forest or onto a boat for maximum silence
and this little device (along with a kindle)
could keep me quite entertained without the need of a big energy source.
</p>

<p>
and i suspect it wouldn&apos;t be too complicated to build such a device.
maybe one could hack it together with some preexisting components.
but to be fair, i don&apos;t have any hardware experience,
and i don&apos;t really have a big need for such a device
(i&apos;m not mobile -- i spend almost all my life sitting at home)
so i&apos;m unlikely to ever attempt to create such a device.
i&apos;m just saying it would be nice if it existed.
