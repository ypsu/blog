<p>
i&apos;m quite the sucker for temptations and vices.
i&apos;ve managed to avoid the worst ones
and fortunately no vice takes up too much time from me on average.
but sometimes i have a flareup and then i tend to go overboard with things.
i decide to check out a manga, an anime or a game,
and then i&apos;m spending 10 hours per day consuming it up to several weeks.
i guess i have issues with moderation.
during those flareups this can really affect my general productivity.
in the past i had all sorts of addictions
but i managed to cure myself out of them.
i do that by avoiding the triggers and resisting the temptations.
but sometimes it takes quite a long time for me to enact countermeasures.
here&apos;s a random sampling of addictions i have or had in the past:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much time on reddit or hackernews,
</li><li>
  too much time gaming,
</li><li>
  eating too much junk food,
</li><li>
  reading too many blogs,
</li><li>
  watching too much youtube, anime, or movies,
</li><li>
  obsessively checking my email,
</li><li>
  masturbating too much.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in moderation they are fine,
but when i go overboard, i often regret all the wasted time and energy.
i regret not spending the time on stuff i know i wouldn&apos;t regret.
here&apos;s a sampling of stuff after which i feel somewhat good:
</p>

<ul><li>
  finishing some work related tasks,
</li><li>
  writing a blog post, demo, game,
</li><li>
  exchanging emails with people,
</li><li>
  spending time with people i like.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
if i have a flareup of one of the former activities,
these preferred activities get much less attention,
which means i don&apos;t feel very good about myself.
all of these good things require a lot of energy to start them,
and if the activation energy is too high,
i&apos;m more tempted to procrastinate with the former activities.
</p>

<p>
i was thinking what options i have to help myself.
one common tip against bad habits is to replace them with different habits.
that sort of works but it&apos;s quite hard.
and it doesn&apos;t really help with the flareups,
where you spend a lot of time in a short burst on an activity.
i want something that would force me to moderate myself
and works regardless of activity.
</p>

<p>
my sudden idea is to assign an &quot;energy cost&quot; for those regretful activities.
i then have a limited supply of energy and i have to budget it thoughtfully.
if i have a lot of energy saved, i can let myself have some fun.
if i&apos;m low on energy, i can only allow the simplest things like checking email.
this still allows me to do things in bursts (that&apos;s my preference),
but thanks to the tracking
i can now rely on the system that it will prevent me from going overboard.
</p>

<p>
what should be the source of this energy?
well, these days i spend all my days indoors thanks to the covid19 lockdowns.
i just sit all day long.
i don&apos;t get any exercise at all.
therefore i decided to gain energy from doing some simple exercises.
the goal isn&apos;t to get buffed from these exercises,
but to have less zero days.
zero day means a day where you didn&apos;t do anything useful.
the goal is to avoid them.
so i guess this little gamification could help me avoid them.
</p>

<p>
i started this system when i was writing this post,
and i felt that it already helped me to curb my email checking addiction.
i don&apos;t want to waste my hard earned energy points on this silly habit.
there&apos;s no need to check it more than a few times a day.
this allows me to focus better
and makes it actually possible to write this post.
one could say that i&apos;m actually quantifying my opportunity cost
and i&apos;m using my loss aversion tendency to battle the bad habits.
</p>

<p>
to make things harder, i track energy in multiple dimensions.
each exercise type i track gets its own dimension.
for example i can start with three dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  pushup: 1 pushup = 1 pushup energy
</li><li>
  pullup: 1 pullup = 2 pullup energy
</li><li>
  squat: 2 squats = 1 squat energy
</li>
</ul>

<p>
in this example different exercises convert to different amount of energy.
pullups are hard for me, so i&apos;d get more energy from a single pushup.
squats are relatively easy, so i&apos;d need to do more from it for a single point.
</p>

<p>
to use up some energy, i subtract that energy from all dimensions!
for example if i have pushup:7 pullup:6 squat:3 energy levels,
and checking on email costs 2 energy points,
then after that i&apos;d have pushup:5 pullup:4 squat:1 energy remaining.
i&apos;d need to do 2 squats again before i could check on my email again.
i subtract from all dimensions to ensure my exercises are somewhat balanced.
the goal of the system is to stay in the positive range
and rack up enough buffer
so that i can enjoy some of the bad activities when i feel down.
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s super easy to add and remove exercise dimensions as i see fit.
maybe i get some dumbbells and then i can add a dumbbell curls.
maybe some day i want to focus on being more outside.
then i can add an outside dimension
which will result in 2 energy points for every minute spent outside.
or if pushups become to easy,
i can just change my accounting so that i need 2 pushups for each energy point.
or maybe i break a leg bone, then i can remove tracking squat for a while.
</p>

<p>
the nice thing about using exercises is
that after an exercise i feel more motivated to do sensible stuff.
exercise somehow wakes up my spirit.
so this system not only limits my bad habits,
but it also motivates me to spend time on my preferred activities.
and getting some exercise out of it is not a bad deal either.
i tried going to gym a while ago.
i&apos;ve lasted a couple months but i found it incredibly boring.
i felt that there was just no point to it.
but this system gives me some goal for the exercises.
i understand that these little exercises don&apos;t substitute real exercise.
however i&apos;m more likely to do it several times per day
which is good from a &quot;take a break from the computer&quot; perspective at least.
by the way, this style of training is called &quot;grease the groove&quot;,
although i&apos;m not taking this experiment seriously enough to call it a training.
</p>

<p>
i also have a lot of flexibility over costs too.
for example i can start with this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1 point for each minute of youtube, anime, tv watched or game played,
</li><li>
  2 points for checking on email,
</li><li>
  10 points for checking on memes or aggregators,
</li><li>
  10 points for eating some junk food.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
the costs are arbitrary
and subject to constant tweaking based on how i feel about my habits.
in order for me to binge watch a long anime,
i have to buffer up a lot of energy.
which is good, because at least my body got something out of it.
and since i couldn&apos;t watch said anime until i buffered up enough energy,
i probably spent a lot of time on doing nice stuff in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t plan to use this as an excuse to restart my old bad habits.
i&apos;d still heavily avoid hackernews for example.
one visit to that site and my day is ruined.
it&apos;s more for protection against accidental visits or accidental new habits.
if i notice i started doing something that i regret afterwards,
i can quickly assign some cost to it and thus limit myself.
</p>

<p>
i also put an upper limit of 1000 points on the values in the dimensions.
for example that&apos;s about 16.5 hours of anime watching.
this way i can be certain
that i won&apos;t burn more than 2 days in a row just on a single anime.
the other function of the upper limit,
is to signal that an exercise is maybe too easy.
if i can easily reach 1000 in a dimension, maybe i should make it harder.
e.g. if i could easily make 1000 pushups in a few days (i wish),
i could change the accounting to have 2 pushups only mean 1 point.
or maybe i could pushups with a weighted vest.
</p>

<p>
although the system allows the energy levels to go below 0,
but i wouldn&apos;t allow that to happen (hopefully).
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s relatively easy to track this on pen and paper.
all you need is a table.
each row should have a timestamp (mmdd hhmm format to save space),
and the latest energy levels for each dimension.
suppose it&apos;s july 17 and you start with 10 energy points in each dimension,
check on the email, then do another 2 pushups, then watch a cat video next day.
your table would look like this:
</p>

<pre>
  timestamp | pushup | pullup | squat | comment
  ----------+--------+--------+-------+--------
  0717 0800 |     10 |     10 |    10 |
       0817 |      8 |      8 |     8 | email
       0820 |     10 |        |       |
  0718 0703 |      6 |      4 |     4 | 4min cat video
</pre>

<p>
the comment column is optional, i think i would leave it empty most of the time.
and if the level is the same as in the previous row, i can leave that empty too.
timestamp is also optional to track.
if you do it, you can then graph your energy levels over time.
even if you do that, tracking hour and minute might be overkill,
maybe just note the day and track only that.
</p>

<p>
in my case i spend almost all my time in front of the computer,
so obviously i made a script for myself to do this tracking.
i made a little &quot;enacc&quot; tool and it logs all my changes into the ~/.enacc file.
enacc stands for energy accounting tool.
i can write &quot;enacc 2&quot; and it subtracts 2 from all dimensions.
then it prints the current stats.
i can write &quot;enacc pushup 10&quot; and it logs that i gained 10 pushup points.
i can just write &quot;enacc&quot; and it displays usage and the comments from ~/.enacc.
i keep my current dimensions and costs in the comments in that file,
so this way i can easily remind myself of my commitments.
here&apos;s an example run:
</p>

<pre>
  $ enacc
  enacc - energy accounter.
  usage 1: enacc [dim val]...
  usage 2: enacc [val]
  dim is either &apos;sub&apos; or one of the energy dimensions.
  dim &apos;sub&apos; subtracts val from each energy dimension.
  otherwise val is added to the specific dimension.
  val on its own is the same as &apos;sub val&apos;.
  ~/.enacc file comments and energy levels:
  # dimensions:
  # - push: 1 ordinary pushup.
  # - pull: 1 inverted pushup with the help of a desk.
  # - jump: 2 jumping jumps for each energy point.
  # costs:
  # - checking email or running the todo script: 2
  # - for each minute of video entertainment: 1
  # - for each minute of gaming: 1
  # - checking on memes or aggregators: 10
  # - eating junk food: 10
  # - masturbation: 20
  push:24 pull:14 jump:14
</pre>

<p>
that output was generated from this file:
</p>

<pre>
  $ cat ~/.enacc
  # dimensions:
  # - push: 1 ordinary pushup.
  # - pull: 1 inverted pushup with the help of a desk.
  # - jump: 2 jumping jumps for each energy point.
  # costs:
  # - checking email or running the todo script: 2
  # - for each minute of video entertainment: 1
  # - for each minute of gaming: 1
  # - checking on memes or aggregators: 10
  # - eating junk food: 10
  # - masturbation: 20

<p>
i track a full timestamp here because for computers that&apos;s not a problem.
i keep this script in my utilities repo here:
https://github.com/ypsu/cfg/blob/master/utils/enacc.c
</p>

<p>
it&apos;s a linux commandline utility though.
there are probably gazillion more mature apps doing the same.
maybe they can make the tracking even simpler.
i don&apos;t know, i haven&apos;t researched this area online,
i might have missed some nice improvements.
i came up with this on my own
after being frustrated with watching too much anime recently.
maybe try the paper tracking first
before investing too much time in a complicated tool though.
</p>

<p>
i also don&apos;t track on what i wasted my energy points on.
it would just add more toil tracking this and i&apos;d be more likely to give up.
i want the process to be as easy as possible, so i only care about the numbers.
to be fair, i wouldn&apos;t even care about using a log format in my tool,
and just have like 3 numbers in a text file representing the actual levels.
the only reason i use the log format because then i can easily append to it.
i don&apos;t like rewriting files because it&apos;s brittle from coding perspective.
but appending to files is usually a very safe and easy operation to implement.
just think about tracking this on paper:
appending is the only sensible way to do it.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t actually know if i&apos;ll be able to commit myself to this system long term.
but uncertainty should stop me from trying random stuff.
it&apos;s definitely worth a try and see how it goes.
</p>

<h2 id="pens">pens</h2>
<p>
i quite like to write on paper.
it just feels oddly satisfying to draw letters nicely.
if there&apos;s no time pressure,
then i prefer writing on paper to writing on the computer.
sometimes i even write my emails or blog posts in my notebook first.
but most of the time i write just to think.
simply writing down my thoughts often cuts my mental deadlocks.
circular or obsessive thoughts are very easy to spot in writing.
and if you spot them, it&apos;s much easier to avoid them.
so as long as i &quot;think&quot; via writing, my &quot;thinking&quot; is more effective.
</p>

<p>
anyways, writing requires pens, and i just wanted to note my preferences.
maybe the world will make more pens like them thanks to this post, who knows.
i didn&apos;t give pens much thought for a long time.
i just thought all of them are crappy
until i learned that there are nice ones too.
it was during my 2nd year in university,
when a freshman roommate showed me his pen.
it was a uniball 0.38 signo dx (um-151).
i really liked how thin the writing was.
i started using one.
the ink was fast drying too,
so i had much less smudging,
and my hands stopped being all ink all the time.
i then ordered a box of 0.28 ones straight from america.
that was a very wise decision.
those pens lasted my whole university time.
</p>

<p>
the reason i like fine lines is because i use relatively small letters.
i&apos;m quite myopic, about -5d (and worsening).
that means i see clearly only up to 20cm.
so i keep my head bove the paper about that distance.
small letters let me have enough space in a small area.
and for small letters i really need a fine pen.
</p>

<p>
now i live in switzerland and those signo dx pens are hard to come by.
so now i&apos;m testing the sakura pigma microns.
i only started using them a few weeks ago.
it was a bit weird initially since it is a plastic needle tip pen.
i didn&apos;t use such a pen before.
but they feel super nice to write with.
they are not super thin though.
even the smallest, 0.05 version feels about the same as the 0.38 signo dx.
side note: some pens report the nib size, others report the resulting line size.
no idea why they can&apos;t all use the same measurement to number their pens.
</p>

<p>
the only annoying thing about the pigma micron is that it is brittle.
the problem is that its tip slowly goes back inside its metal frame.
perhaps i&apos;m using way too much pressure while writing.
after a while it becomes very inconvenient or unable to write,
even though there&apos;s plenty of ink remaining.
and it&apos;s not something that can be easily repaired.
or at least i&apos;m not skilled enough to repair such a fine instrument.
if these pens wouldn&apos;t have this flaw,
i&apos;d be happy to use them instead of the signo dx pens.
but if i have to choose,
i think i&apos;d still stick with the 0.28 signo dx pens.
another advantage of the signo dx pens is,
that you can clearly see the amount of the remaining ink.
the pigma microns lack this feature.
not that i ever managed to write one dry.
</p>

<p>
btw, i understand not everyone likes small letters or fine lines.
if i were to write something for others to read,
i might use bigger letters and thicker pens.
i recently tried the uniball eye micro (ub-150).
it is quite thick, but also very nice to write with.
i&apos;d probably use that one for such writing (or a thicker pigma micron).
</p>

<p>
as for paper, i use a spiraled a5 graph ruled notebook.
the grid is really helpful in nicely aligning my text or sometimes a drawing.
i don&apos;t really like to use a completely clean paper.
i don&apos;t think i have a preference about paper weight.
if the paper is smooth and the ink doesn&apos;t bleed to the other side, i&apos;m happy.
</p>

<p>
so i like to handwrite.
do i like reading other people&apos;s handwriting?
hell no!
most people simply can&apos;t write readably.
i even seen people who have very &quot;aesthetically&quot; looking writing,
but it was still unreadable to me.
during school some people did sometimes note that my writing is a bit ugly,
but at the same time it was super rare that someone asked for a clarification.
so even if my writing is ugly, at least it&apos;s somewhat readable.
that&apos;s the important part.
i guess people just don&apos;t really care about readability these modern times.
handwriting is a lost art.
btw, if curious about my handwriting, i took a photo of a page of my writing.
it&apos;s at /pens.jpg.
this one is quite ugly though.
i usually write much nicer if i expect others to read it.
i didn&apos;t know i&apos;ll take a photo back then, so i didn&apos;t spend effort on niceness.
at least you can see my ugly side.
in any case, i wouldn&apos;t really want to communicate via handwriting.
i prefer reading nicely printed text instead (if short then screen is fine too).
</p>

<p>
btw, one disclaimer to these preferences:
i&apos;m no big pen guru.
i haven&apos;t tried many pens.
so i constructed my preferences from a small sample size.
if anyone knows cheap, available pens i&apos;d like, then let me know.
</p>

<p>
anyways, to summarize,
my favorite pens are (in this order, assuming their finest version):
</p>

<ul><li>
  uniball signo dx (um-151)
</li><li>
  sakura pigma micron
</li><li>
  uniball eye micro (ub-150)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
edit: not long after writing this post, i had an idea.
i realized that i found it quite uncomfortable
to write on the left side of the notebook.
my wrist rested on the spiral.
and it was really annoying whenever i had to write near the right margin.
the spiral was getting in the way of the pen.
so i decided that from now on i&apos;ll just flip the notebook for the left side.
so every time i start a new page, i have to flip the notebook.
or more specifically: rotate the notebook 180 degrees.
/pens.jpg shows the old style.
in the new style i&apos;d have flipped the notebook.
the sentences would always start at the spiral, no matter where i write.
this would be annoying if i wanted to read the notebook,
but for me it&apos;s mostly write only.
the reading inconvenience of the flipping is worth the writing convenience.
i&apos;ll totally do this from now and see how it goes.
</p>

<h2 id="dyncam">dyncam</h2>
<p>
i keep my work laptop under my desk.
i plug an external monitor, keyboard, mouse into it.
i basically use it as a workstation.
therefore its builtin webcam and microphone are not really accessible to me.
these days i use a smartphone for the meetings.
i was wondering,
could i still use my laptop and just present a nice avatar on meetings?
</p>

<p>
an avatar that would stand still if i wasn&apos;t doing active.
but it would talk if i talked.
or it would be nodding yes or no if i wanted to be nodding.
nothing fancy, but streaming simple, manually controlled, precanned animations.
</p>

<p>
if you are a sensible person, you would use obs studio for this.
but obviously i&apos;m too cheapskate to install and learn new free software.
so i decided to find my own ways to solve this problem.
the information here is absolutely of no use for anyone (if not harmful),
i just thought i document it for my own future reference.
(so that i have more content to facepalm myself about when i get old.)
</p>

<p>
i chose phoenix wright from the ace attorney game as my virtual avatar.
it&apos;s about an attorney who must solve crimes right in the courtroom.
his iconic move is saying &quot;objection&quot; whenever he hears a contradiction.
it&apos;s a gameboy game and i found gif rips online.
i found 9 animations i liked:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. just standing (and occasionally blinking)
</li><li>
  2. normal talking (this is what i&apos;d use when i talk)
</li><li>
  3. determined talking (he leans in as he talks)
</li><li>
  4. thinking pose
</li><li>
  5. talking in the thinking pose
</li><li>
  6. ashamed talking
</li><li>
  7. nodding yes
</li><li>
  8. nodding no
</li><li>
  9. despair pose
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it doesn&apos;t have to be anime characters.
one could prerecord short loops of themselves too.
the point is that i have 9 mpg files called 1.mpg ... 9.mpg,
and that all these animations can be looped.
i want a little interface where i can choose the currently looping animation.
</p>

<p>
since the original art was gifs, i converted them into mpg files like this:
</p>

<pre>
  ffmpeg -re -i phoenix/anim008.gif -map 0:v -pix_fmt yuv420p \
    -filter:v crop=960:540:0:0 3.mpg
</pre>

<p>
then i needed a virtual webcam to stream these gifs into.
i created one like this:
</p>

<pre>
  modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1
</pre>

<p>
now comes the tricky part.
it&apos;s pretty easy to stream a particular video into such a virtual webcam.
however what i want here is a little control box,
with which i can dynamically change what i stream into the webcam.
one obvious idea is to have ffmpeg loop a video statically into the webcam.
whenever i want to change the animation,
i kill the current ffmpeg and start a new one with the new animation.
this felt unclean.
and sometimes it messed up the virtual webcam.
it was flaky due to unclean exits, i presume.
i needed a saner solution.
preferably something that doesn&apos;t really require me to code up anything.
i found a very ugly hack which allowed me to do this.
</p>

<p>
ffmpeg has a feature where you can tell it to load a list of files from a file.
it can then concatenate those files and loop them.
so i created a simple loop.txt containing these two files:
</p>

<pre>
  file a.mpg
  file b.mpg
</pre>

<p>
i instruct ffmpeg to loop concatenating these two files.
in order to switch animation,
i just replace these files with the new animation.
yes, i need two separate files.
otherwise ffmpeg doesn&apos;t reopen the file.
it would keep playing the old animation even if i overwrote the underlying file.
i guess this makes sense from an optimization perspective.
</p>

<p>
so then i just wrote a script that reads digits and rewrites files in a loop.
i had one extra requirement though.
my animation selection console is running in a terminal.
the vidconf software is running in a browser.
i wanted to be able to mute and unmute straight from the terminal script.
so for that i used xdotool.
whenever i press the 0 key i do this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. focus the browser,
</li><li>
  2. send the mute/unmute keybinding,
</li><li>
  3. focus back the terminal.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
ugh, i know.
for reference here&apos;s the full bash monstrosity:
</p>

<pre>
  #/bin/bash
  echo select the browser window with the vidconf.
  current=$(xdotool getactivewindow)
  browser=$(xdotool selectwindow)
  echo
</pre>

<pre>
  # remind myself of my options.
  echo &apos;1watch        2talk         3determined&apos;
  echo &apos;4thinking     5thinktalk    6ashamedtalk&apos;
  echo &apos;7yes          8no           9despair&apos;
</pre>

<pre>
  # set the inital, standing only animation.
  cp 1.mpg a.mpg
  cp 1.mpg b.mpg
  # start the endless ffmpeg stream.

<p>
it&apos;s a terrible way to do this but it works okay.
i&apos;m pretty sure the gazillion ways to do this better.
the main limitation is that it can only switch to the next animation,
when the current animation has finished.
so it only works with short animations.
but that was the case for me so that wasn&apos;t a big deal.
i don&apos;t really use this thing often though,
but sounded like a fun enough solution to share.

if you are reading the html version of this on a desktop,
then open the developer console (key f12, usually) and enter this:
</p>

<pre>
  document.head.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;style&gt;p{white-space:pre-wrap;}&lt;/style&gt;&quot;;
</pre>

<p>
this will make this post look use the semantic linebreaks too.
</p>

<p>
semantic linebreaks is an old idea where you put newlines after thought ends.
basically a newline after the periods or thought joining commas.
previously i used to format my plaintext to 80 characters.
i never really liked the &quot;write a paragraph per line&quot; style of editing.
now i think semantic linebreaks are superior to 80 character wrapping.
first, it has many technological advantages.
you don&apos;t have to reformat your lines after each edit.
that takes out a lot of churn out of this old style text editing.
making edits with a line oriented editor like vim also gets easier.
it&apos;s super easy to shuffle text around, or just rewrite small parts.
such edits look much simpler in text diffing tools too.
</p>

<p>
then there&apos;s the other, emotional aspect of it.
now keep in mind, that i still limit myself to 80 characters per line.
with sembreaks this means that all my thoughts must fit 80 characters.
i still permit separate clauses to spill onto separate lines though.
i used this style for a few weeks now in personal writing.
it does feel that it makes my sentencer simpler, perhaps more childish.
but i feel more clarity out of them.
this way i must find the beginning and the end of each thought.
each thought must be short and must stand on its own.
i can&apos;t drone on and on without saying anything.
i feel that this creative limitation helps me to think.
it forces me to break down those swirling thoughts into digestible pieces.
</p>

<p>
i think, though not sure how to show, but this makes reading easier too.
think of the process of programming.
we also put all the statements onto their own, separate lines.
it would look weird if you would format code to 80 characters.
it just feels cleaner when done this way.
so why wouldn&apos;t we want this extra clarity from ordinary text too?
</p>

<p>
this method does make text use up more vertical space.
in some cases this can be a disadvantage.
perhaps in the ancient times the paper was expensive.
or people don&apos;t like overly thick books.
but on computer screen i think the extra height is not an issue.
</p>

<p>
i tried to convert ordinary text into sembreak&apos;d style with this script:
</p>

<pre>
  document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/[:;.?!,] /g, &apos;$&amp;&lt;br&gt;&apos;)
</pre>

<p>
it didn&apos;t work.
if something wasn&apos;t written with the 80 character / thought limit,
then sembreaks won&apos;t make it easier to read.
</p>

<p>
it also initally makes the text to look like poetry.
it adds some rythm to the text and it feels a little bit weird to read.
search for &quot;ventilated prose&quot; and see the discussion around this.
with that search term you&apos;ll see so other examples of this style.
but i see that a lot of examples are splitting mid-thought.
they use super narrow margins.
they never really recommend a specific character limit.
they let people go with their gut feelings of what is long.
i don&apos;t really like this approach, i prefer static limits.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s also a lot of discussion about how manual wrapping is 70-ies tech.
that this day and age we should just write full paragraphs per line.
i don&apos;t really have a good argument against this.
if people don&apos;t mind relying on fancy text editors for text editing,
then they should go for it.
i&apos;m old school, and i like relying on less tech to do simple things.
hence i wrap manually and now semantically.
besides, if you write markdown or html, the renderers will reformat anyways.
</p>

<p>
i started writing my personal emails with this style.
my emails are always plaintext.
looks like nobody was bothered enough to complain about this style.
maybe people don&apos;t mind reading text like this.
i&apos;m now trying to write my work emails like this too and see how it goes.
maybe the idea catches on eventually.
maybe someone else will start communicating with me with this style.
then, hopefully, i&apos;ll be able to tell if it really makes things nicer or not.
for now i&apos;ll just keep the solo experiment going.
