<h2 id="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>make paperwork fun!</p>
<p>
i hear some warnings that eventually humanity won&apos;t be able to employ most people meaningfully
when robots can do most of the mundane tasks for us.
that might be true but i don&apos;t see that humanity would ever run out of jobs.
i expect bureaucracy will take up most of the time of people.
i mean even unemployed people have to spend a lot of time trapped in various procedures,
e.g. waiting in lines, seeking jobs, interviewing, etc.
unemployment can be like a full time job.
</p>

<p>
here&apos;s a random list of tasks that can be associated with the ever growing bureaucracy (listed alphabetically):
</p>

<ul><li>
  budgeting
</li><li>
  checklists
</li><li>
  compliance audits
</li><li>
  expense reports
</li><li>
  interviewing
</li><li>
  managing people
</li><li>
  meetings
</li><li>
  organizing
</li><li>
  peer reviews
</li><li>
  performance reviews
</li><li>
  planning
</li><li>
  preparing presentations
</li><li>
  queueing in lines
</li><li>
  retrospectives
</li><li>
  routine spot checks (e.g. by police)
</li><li>
  safety inspections
</li><li>
  tax return filing
</li><li>
  ticket filing
</li><li>
  timesheet filing
</li>
</ul>

<p>
everything makes sense on its own but when taken all together
then it feels that humanity spends more and more time on busywork.
we can always find some paperwork to do for any person on earth at any time.
</p>

<p>
one way out of this is starting a company or government anew with a clean slate.
or maybe you can fight against the existing bureaucracy.
but what if you are not in a mood for a fight?
one can try changing their perception about the whole thing.
a lot of these things are painful because they are forced on people
and because they often have to struggle through them alone.
</p>

<p>
try making all the unnecessary paperwork more fun.
if you have to fill boring forms (e.g. tax returns)
maybe draw or write some art to the margins.
make it the best looking tax return ever!
</p>

<p>
a peer wants you to peer review something for them?
if they are a gym buff then ask them to do 100 pushups for your review.
they might be glad that you motivated them to do the pushups
and in exchange you feel good about yourself being such a good motivator.
</p>

<p>
or pair up with someone to tackle stuff you hate together.
you need to write some sort of report?
make it an improv game where each person must write a sentence in turn.
sure, it might not be the best report in the end,
but at least you have something to hand in and you had some fun while writing it.
</p>

<p>
need to itemize a long expense report?
if each item has a comment section
then write some witty reason for each item.
you can do this together if you found a partner.
e.g. you can fill the details of the actual item while your partner writes the witty comment.
if management protests the total time spent on writing this report
then you can start arguing against the need of such report in the first place.
</p>

<p>
if some task was utterly pointless and you couldn&apos;t find a way to make it fun
then you can blog about the utter pointlessness of such tasks every time you do it.
maybe you gain enough followers with whom you can start a serious opposition of the need for the task
or maybe someone can point out a way to make it fun for you.
</p>

<p>
if you are creating some bureaucratic form,
then make sure you leave some space for people to express some creativity.
at least add some free form comment or feedback section.
and then do publish that feedback somewhere.
</p>

<p>
if you can make it fun then all this bureaucracy might not be such a bad thing in the end.
in fact it might be a nice utopia:
everyone has something to do and people have fun while doing it.
i&apos;m not saying i like bureaucracy,
i&apos;m just trying to look on the bright side of things.
</p>

<h2 id="news">news</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>ideas about relevant newsletters.</p>
<p>
i don&apos;t really follow news and newsletters.
the stoic wisdom says &quot;focus on things you can control&quot;.
well, news is full of things i can&apos;t control.
it contains mostly unactionable passages that makes me angry and depressed.
it also make me distracted and i focus less on things i actually want to achieve.
</p>

<p>
i can imagine a relevant newsletter for me though.
it would be very local:
it would be made and involve people and places i interact with daily
(e.g. my team and workplace, a sport club and its arena, a neighborhood and its street,
a group of friends and their favorite pub).
i&apos;m imagining a monthly newsletter with topics like this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  a short interview with a peer so that i get to know someone more;
</li><li>
  a short summary of a peer&apos;s work or hobby;
</li><li>
  a free form poll or two about some upcoming fun event, or some other change;
</li><li>
  one line summary of the past month or their current mood from each peer;
</li><li>
  any soapbox writing, tips and tricks written by a peer;
</li><li>
  summary of any relevant upcoming events and changes around the team;
</li><li>
  a selection of gossips and best quotes made by the peers;
</li><li>
  anonymous messages in case people want to whistleblow or point out uncool stuff without their name.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
not all of the above must be present in an instance of the newsletter.
just a few is enough.
the whole thing should be short.
it should fit on a page or two
so that i can skim it through quickly.
the goal of such a newsletter wouldn&apos;t be to fully inform people.
it should be to raise awareness and interest about my peers.
and since they are my peers,
i can freely ask them in person about their short snippet from the newsletter.
this means that the snippets are somewhat actionable for me.
it gives the people relevant topics to chat about.
such a newsletter probably doesn&apos;t make sense below 5 people
and above a dozen people it starts getting irrelevant.
it should be put together by the same person all the time so that quality remains constant.
</p>

<p>
on the other hand i can see that such newsletter might require lot of time investment
and thus might not worth it.
maybe it might make sense only when the team morale or cohesion is low.
a team in such scenario could commit to make 6 issues (e.g. 1 per month for half a year)
and then see if people find it useful or not.
in case there&apos;s a newsletter already and if one doesn&apos;t find it too relevant,
maybe one could ask the writers to include more items like the above.
at least now i think i know what to ask for
whenever someone tries to start a newsletter around me.
</p>

<h2 id="ffpoll">ffpoll</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>free form poll results are more usable.</p>
<p>
how do you poll people?
the typical form i see is this:
</p>

<pre>
  do you want x?
</pre>

<pre>
  [ ] yes
  [ ] no
</pre>

<pre>
  some other question?
</pre>

<pre>
  [ ] option 1
  [ ] option 2
  [ ] option 3
</pre>

<p>
and you are expected to put a cross next to your answer.
the whole thing is then very easy to summarize.
but i think the result is often quite puzzling
because nobody understands why people voted the way they voted.
</p>

<p>
i prefer this form:
</p>

<pre>
  do you want x?
</pre>

<pre>
  -          yes because: ________
  -           no because: ________
  - alternative proposal: ________
</pre>

<pre>
  some other question?
</pre>

<pre>
  -     option 1 because: ________
  -     option 2 because: ________
  -     option 3 because: ________
  - alternative proposal: ________
</pre>

<p>
in this form you are giving free form responses.
you can still just put an x down next to the option you want
in case you don&apos;t want to expand your rationale.
so this form is also easy to summarize.
but people often do want to express nuance
and this manages to capture that.
this lets pollsters better understand why people voted the way they voted.
the result is then hopefully less of a mystery.
make sure to publish the free form text too
not just the absolute number of responses
(perhaps with some editorialization if some responses can&apos;t be published).
</p>

<p>
i&apos;m also fan of the alternative proposal line
because i don&apos;t like forcing people into false dilemmas.
it gives a way for people to explain their reason for abstaining.
and sometimes you might find a good alternative solution with it.
</p>

<p>
note that this has some limitations.
if a person chooses to give a rationale,
you might be able to identify said person even if the form was anonymous.
and such deliberate voting can take a lot of time.
so it mostly works for polls where anonymity is not important
and there&apos;s no time pressure.
</p>

<p>
i don&apos;t have much experience with this
but i&apos;m hoping that this gets more popular over time.
if it doesn&apos;t really work, i guess i&apos;ll try to make peace with the simple form.
</p>

<h2 id="cmv">cmv</h2>
<p style=font-weight:bold>r/changemyview is a pretty safe corner in the harsh internet.</p>
<p>
https://reddit.com/r/changemyview is a heavily moderated forum with strict rules
that try to maintain civility in very sensitive topics.
usually such topics go crazy very quickly on a typical internet forum
but this doesn&apos;t seem to plague this forum.
</p>

<p>
the idea is that someone posts some view they harbor
and the commenters will try to convince the author of the opposite,
or at least have the author learn more nuance about the issues.
funny comments, agreeing with the author, rudeness gets all removed
so the thread stays very much focused on the author&apos;s view.
</p>

<p>
and the whole thing is gamified.
whenever the author acknowledges that they have shifted their view
or gained a more nuanced view about their issue thanks to a comment,
they have to give that comment a &quot;delta&quot;.
basically they have to include &quot;!delta&quot; or &quot;Δ&quot; in their response.
a bot then counts the delta points over the whole subreddit
and displays the accumulated delta points next to each username.
it&apos;s probably a nice feeling to get rewarded with such a point
and that might keep people engaged in the discussions.
</p>

<p>
the delta system also helps researchers to understand
what makes some comments more persuasive than others.
here&apos;s one academic&apos;s research site about this.
note specifically the media coverage section:
https://chenhaot.com/pages/changemyview.html.
</p>

<p>
i&apos;ve tried posting some of my crazy views to see what happens:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /uppercase: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/oaqzcz/cmv_writing_doesnt_inherently_need_uppercase
</li><li>
  /binding: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o0z5jj/cmv_books_should_be_wirebound/
</li><li>
  /intmon: https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ofdnn1/cmv_a_copyrightpatentipfree_world_is_nicer/
</li>
</ul>

<p>
although the discourse remains relatively civil,
the whole thing is quite overwhelming.
for one, there&apos;s a lot of repetition
since most commenters don&apos;t seem to read the other comment threads.
and some commenters seem still quite mean even if they are within all the rules
which can make responding to the commenters quite exhausting emotionally.
</p>

<p>
and then i quickly learn that most issues can be broken down into smaller issues
that need to be discussed separately.
discussing everything in one big thread can get confusing.
e.g. when i wanted to argue about the usage of uppercase letters,
i could break that down into capitalization of sentence beginnings
and the capitalization of names.
those must be argued completely differently.
</p>

<p>
and it&apos;s incredibly time consuming.
understanding your opponents&apos; arguments,
preparing a detailed but short response is not trivial.
i think such discussions can&apos;t happen on a very short timeframe.
while i gained a bit of nuance during the discussions,
they didn&apos;t fundamentally change my views.
i feel i&apos;d need to invest more time into the whole thing for that to happen,
not just the few hours i reserved to test the site.
</p>

<p>
and i felt quite disconnected from my opponents:
i didn&apos;t feel i understand them, and i didn&apos;t feel they understand me either.
i think anonymous forums are not for me.
i prefer to know my opponent personally, i think that can make the communication more effective.
i think i&apos;d prefer to be paired with a single person to discuss an issue over months
and maybe then present a shared document that contains our agreement
rather than arguing with a dozen people at the same time.
reddit doesn&apos;t really have a good way to present long back&amp;forth discussions anyways.
</p>

<p>
while i probably won&apos;t be posting much to r/changemyview,
it&apos;s definitely a site where i can look up discussions about almost any topic.
all i need to do is to append &quot;site:reddit.com/r/changemyview&quot; into my search query.
i recommend anyone fancying online discussions to explore this site too.
