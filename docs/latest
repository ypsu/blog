<h2 id="pens">pens</h2>
<p>
i quite like to write on paper.
it just feels oddly satisfying to draw letters nicely.
if there&apos;s no time pressure,
then i prefer writing on paper to writing on the computer.
sometimes i even write my emails or blog posts in my notebook first.
but most of the time i write just to think.
simply writing down my thoughts often cuts my mental deadlocks.
circular or obsessive thoughts are very easy to spot in writing.
and if you spot them, it&apos;s much easier to avoid them.
so as long as i &quot;think&quot; via writing, my &quot;thinking&quot; is more effective.
</p>

<p>
anyways, writing requires pens, and i just wanted to note my preferences.
maybe the world will make more pens like them thanks to this post, who knows.
i didn&apos;t give pens much thought for a long time.
i just thought all of them are crappy
until i learned that there are nice ones too.
it was during my 2nd year in university,
when a freshman roommate showed me his pen.
it was a uniball 0.38 signo dx (um-151).
i really liked how thin the writing was.
i started using one.
the ink was fast drying too,
so i had much less smudging,
and my hands stopped being all ink all the time.
i then ordered a box of 0.28 ones straight from america.
that was a very wise decision.
those pens lasted my whole university time.
</p>

<p>
the reason i like fine lines is because i use relatively small letters.
i&apos;m quite myopic, about -5d (and worsening).
that means i see clearly only up to 20cm.
so i keep my head bove the paper about that distance.
small letters let me have enough space in a small area.
and for small letters i really need a fine pen.
</p>

<p>
now i live in switzerland and those signo dx pens are hard to come by.
so now i&apos;m testing the sakura pigma microns.
i only started using them a few weeks ago.
it was a bit weird initially since it is a plastic needle tip pen.
i didn&apos;t use such a pen before.
but they feel super nice to write with.
they are not super thin though.
even the smallest, 0.05 version feels about the same as the 0.38 signo dx.
side note: some pens report the nib size, others report the resulting line size.
no idea why they can&apos;t all use the same measurement to number their pens.
</p>

<p>
the only annoying thing about the pigma micron is that it is brittle.
the problem is that its tip slowly goes back inside its metal frame.
perhaps i&apos;m using way too much pressure while writing.
after a while it becomes very inconvenient or unable to write,
even though there&apos;s plenty of ink remaining.
and it&apos;s not something that can be easily repaired.
or at least i&apos;m not skilled enough to repair such a fine instrument.
if these pens wouldn&apos;t have this flaw,
i&apos;d be happy to use them instead of the signo dx pens.
but if i have to choose,
i think i&apos;d still stick with the 0.28 signo dx pens.
another advantage of the signo dx pens is,
that you can clearly see the amount of the remaining ink.
the pigma microns lack this feature.
not that i ever managed to write one dry.
</p>

<p>
btw, i understand not everyone likes small letters or fine lines.
if i were to write something for others to read,
i might use bigger letters and thicker pens.
i recently tried the uniball eye micro (ub-150).
it is quite thick, but also very nice to write with.
i&apos;d probably use that one for such writing (or a thicker pigma micron).
</p>

<p>
as for paper, i use a spiraled a5 graph ruled notebook.
the grid is really helpful in nicely aligning my text or sometimes a drawing.
i don&apos;t really like to use a completely clean paper.
i don&apos;t think i have a preference about paper weight.
if the paper is smooth and the ink doesn&apos;t bleed to the other side, i&apos;m happy.
</p>

<p>
so i like to handwrite.
do i like reading other people&apos;s handwriting?
hell no!
most people simply can&apos;t write readably.
i even seen people who have very &quot;aesthetically&quot; looking writing,
but it was still unreadable to me.
during school some people did sometimes note that my writing is a bit ugly,
but at the same time it was super rare that someone asked for a clarification.
so even if my writing is ugly, at least it&apos;s somewhat readable.
that&apos;s the important part.
i guess people just don&apos;t really care about readability these modern times.
handwriting is a lost art.
btw, if curious about my handwriting, i took a photo of a page of my writing.
it&apos;s at /pens.jpg.
this one is quite ugly though.
i usually write much nicer if i expect others to read it.
i didn&apos;t know i&apos;ll take a photo back then, so i didn&apos;t spend effort on niceness.
at least you can see my ugly side.
in any case, i wouldn&apos;t really want to communicate via handwriting.
i prefer reading nicely printed text instead (if short then screen is fine too).
</p>

<p>
btw, one disclaimer to these preferences:
i&apos;m no big pen guru.
i haven&apos;t tried many pens.
so i constructed my preferences from a small sample size.
if anyone knows cheap, available pens i&apos;d like, then let me know.
</p>

<p>
anyways, to summarize,
my favorite pens are (in this order, assuming their finest version):
</p>

<ul><li>
  uniball signo dx (um-151)
</li><li>
  sakura pigma micron
</li><li>
  uniball eye micro (ub-150)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
edit: not long after writing this post, i had an idea.
i realized that i found it quite uncomfortable
to write on the left side of the notebook.
my wrist rested on the spiral.
and it was really annoying whenever i had to write near the right margin.
the spiral was getting in the way of the pen.
so i decided that from now on i&apos;ll just flip the notebook for the left side.
so every time i start a new page, i have to flip the notebook.
or more specifically: rotate the notebook 180 degrees.
/pens.jpg shows the old style.
in the new style i&apos;d have flipped the notebook.
the sentences would always start at the spiral, no matter where i write.
this would be annoying if i wanted to read the notebook,
but for me it&apos;s mostly write only.
the reading inconvenience of the flipping is worth the writing convenience.
i&apos;ll totally do this from now and see how it goes.
</p>

<h2 id="dyncam">dyncam</h2>
<p>
i keep my work laptop under my desk.
i plug an external monitor, keyboard, mouse into it.
i basically use it as a workstation.
therefore its builtin webcam and microphone are not really accessible to me.
these days i use a smartphone for the meetings.
i was wondering,
could i still use my laptop and just present a nice avatar on meetings?
</p>

<p>
an avatar that would stand still if i wasn&apos;t doing active.
but it would talk if i talked.
or it would be nodding yes or no if i wanted to be nodding.
nothing fancy, but streaming simple, manually controlled, precanned animations.
</p>

<p>
if you are a sensible person, you would use obs studio for this.
but obviously i&apos;m too cheapskate to install and learn new free software.
so i decided to find my own ways to solve this problem.
the information here is absolutely of no use for anyone (if not harmful),
i just thought i document it for my own future reference.
(so that i have more content to facepalm myself about when i get old.)
</p>

<p>
i chose phoenix wright from the ace attorney game as my virtual avatar.
it&apos;s about an attorney who must solve crimes right in the courtroom.
his iconic move is saying &quot;objection&quot; whenever he hears a contradiction.
it&apos;s a gameboy game and i found gif rips online.
i found 9 animations i liked:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. just standing (and occasionally blinking)
</li><li>
  2. normal talking (this is what i&apos;d use when i talk)
</li><li>
  3. determined talking (he leans in as he talks)
</li><li>
  4. thinking pose
</li><li>
  5. talking in the thinking pose
</li><li>
  6. ashamed talking
</li><li>
  7. nodding yes
</li><li>
  8. nodding no
</li><li>
  9. despair pose
</li>
</ul>

<p>
it doesn&apos;t have to be anime characters.
one could prerecord short loops of themselves too.
the point is that i have 9 mpg files called 1.mpg ... 9.mpg,
and that all these animations can be looped.
i want a little interface where i can choose the currently looping animation.
</p>

<p>
since the original art was gifs, i converted them into mpg files like this:
</p>

<pre>
  ffmpeg -re -i phoenix/anim008.gif -map 0:v -pix_fmt yuv420p \
    -filter:v crop=960:540:0:0 3.mpg
</pre>

<p>
then i needed a virtual webcam to stream these gifs into.
i created one like this:
</p>

<pre>
  modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1
</pre>

<p>
now comes the tricky part.
it&apos;s pretty easy to stream a particular video into such a virtual webcam.
however what i want here is a little control box,
with which i can dynamically change what i stream into the webcam.
one obvious idea is to have ffmpeg loop a video statically into the webcam.
whenever i want to change the animation,
i kill the current ffmpeg and start a new one with the new animation.
this felt unclean.
and sometimes it messed up the virtual webcam.
it was flaky due to unclean exits, i presume.
i needed a saner solution.
preferably something that doesn&apos;t really require me to code up anything.
i found a very ugly hack which allowed me to do this.
</p>

<p>
ffmpeg has a feature where you can tell it to load a list of files from a file.
it can then concatenate those files and loop them.
so i created a simple loop.txt containing these two files:
</p>

<pre>
  file a.mpg
  file b.mpg
</pre>

<p>
i instruct ffmpeg to loop concatenating these two files.
in order to switch animation,
i just replace these files with the new animation.
yes, i need two separate files.
otherwise ffmpeg doesn&apos;t reopen the file.
it would keep playing the old animation even if i overwrote the underlying file.
i guess this makes sense from an optimization perspective.
</p>

<p>
so then i just wrote a script that reads digits and rewrites files in a loop.
i had one extra requirement though.
my animation selection console is running in a terminal.
the vidconf software is running in a browser.
i wanted to be able to mute and unmute straight from the terminal script.
so for that i used xdotool.
whenever i press the 0 key i do this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  1. focus the browser,
</li><li>
  2. send the mute/unmute keybinding,
</li><li>
  3. focus back the terminal.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
ugh, i know.
for reference here&apos;s the full bash monstrosity:
</p>

<pre>
  #/bin/bash
  echo select the browser window with the vidconf.
  current=$(xdotool getactivewindow)
  browser=$(xdotool selectwindow)
  echo
</pre>

<pre>
  # remind myself of my options.
  echo &apos;1watch        2talk         3determined&apos;
  echo &apos;4thinking     5thinktalk    6ashamedtalk&apos;
  echo &apos;7yes          8no           9despair&apos;
</pre>

<pre>
  # set the inital, standing only animation.
  cp 1.mpg a.mpg
  cp 1.mpg b.mpg
  # start the endless ffmpeg stream.
  ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stream_loop -1 -re -f concat -i loop.txt -map 0:v \
    -f v4l2 -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -filter:v crop=960:540:0:0 \
    /dev/video2 &amp;
  # read the requested animation from the keyboard.
  while read -sn1 choice; do
    if ! [[ &quot;$choice&quot; =~ ^[0-9]$ ]]; then
      continue
    fi
    if test &quot;$choice&quot; == 0; then
      # mute or unmute.
      xdotool windowactivate --sync &quot;$browser&quot;
      xdotool key ctrl+d
      xdotool windowactivate &quot;$current&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null
      continue;
    fi
    # set the newly desired animation.
    cp $choice.mpg tmp
    mv tmp a.mpg
    cp $choice.mpg tmp
    mv tmp b.mpg
  done
</pre>

<p>
it&apos;s a terrible way to do this but it works okay.
i&apos;m pretty sure the gazillion ways to do this better.
the main limitation is that it can only switch to the next animation,
when the current animation has finished.
so it only works with short animations.
but that was the case for me so that wasn&apos;t a big deal.
i don&apos;t really use this thing often though,
but sounded like a fun enough solution to share.
</p>

<h2 id="sembr">sembr</h2>
<p>
if you are reading the html version of this on a desktop,
then open the developer console (key f12, usually) and enter this:
</p>

<pre>
  document.head.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;style&gt;p{white-space:pre-wrap;}&lt;/style&gt;&quot;;
</pre>

<p>
this will make this post look use the semantic linebreaks too.
</p>

<p>
semantic linebreaks is an old idea where you put newlines after thought ends.
basically a newline after the periods or thought joining commas.
previously i used to format my plaintext to 80 characters.
i never really liked the &quot;write a paragraph per line&quot; style of editing.
now i think semantic linebreaks are superior to 80 character wrapping.
first, it has many technological advantages.
you don&apos;t have to reformat your lines after each edit.
that takes out a lot of churn out of this old style text editing.
making edits with a line oriented editor like vim also gets easier.
it&apos;s super easy to shuffle text around, or just rewrite small parts.
such edits look much simpler in text diffing tools too.
</p>

<p>
then there&apos;s the other, emotional aspect of it.
now keep in mind, that i still limit myself to 80 characters per line.
with sembreaks this means that all my thoughts must fit 80 characters.
i still permit separate clauses to spill onto separate lines though.
i used this style for a few weeks now in personal writing.
it does feel that it makes my sentencer simpler, perhaps more childish.
but i feel more clarity out of them.
this way i must find the beginning and the end of each thought.
each thought must be short and must stand on its own.
i can&apos;t drone on and on without saying anything.
i feel that this creative limitation helps me to think.
it forces me to break down those swirling thoughts into digestible pieces.
</p>

<p>
i think, though not sure how to show, but this makes reading easier too.
think of the process of programming.
we also put all the statements onto their own, separate lines.
it would look weird if you would format code to 80 characters.
it just feels cleaner when done this way.
so why wouldn&apos;t we want this extra clarity from ordinary text too?
</p>

<p>
this method does make text use up more vertical space.
in some cases this can be a disadvantage.
perhaps in the ancient times the paper was expensive.
or people don&apos;t like overly thick books.
but on computer screen i think the extra height is not an issue.
</p>

<p>
i tried to convert ordinary text into sembreak&apos;d style with this script:
</p>

<pre>
  document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/[:;.?!,] /g, &apos;$&amp;&lt;br&gt;&apos;)
</pre>

<p>
it didn&apos;t work.
if something wasn&apos;t written with the 80 character / thought limit,
then sembreaks won&apos;t make it easier to read.
</p>

<p>
it also initally makes the text to look like poetry.
it adds some rythm to the text and it feels a little bit weird to read.
search for &quot;ventilated prose&quot; and see the discussion around this.
with that search term you&apos;ll see so other examples of this style.
but i see that a lot of examples are splitting mid-thought.
they use super narrow margins.
they never really recommend a specific character limit.
they let people go with their gut feelings of what is long.
i don&apos;t really like this approach, i prefer static limits.
</p>

<p>
there&apos;s also a lot of discussion about how manual wrapping is 70-ies tech.
that this day and age we should just write full paragraphs per line.
i don&apos;t really have a good argument against this.
if people don&apos;t mind relying on fancy text editors for text editing,
then they should go for it.
i&apos;m old school, and i like relying on less tech to do simple things.
hence i wrap manually and now semantically.
besides, if you write markdown or html, the renderers will reformat anyways.
</p>

<p>
i started writing my personal emails with this style.
my emails are always plaintext.
looks like nobody was bothered enough to complain about this style.
maybe people don&apos;t mind reading text like this.
i&apos;m now trying to write my work emails like this too and see how it goes.
maybe the idea catches on eventually.
maybe someone else will start communicating with me with this style.
then, hopefully, i&apos;ll be able to tell if it really makes things nicer or not.
for now i&apos;ll just keep the solo experiment going.
</p>

<h2 id="touch">touch</h2>
<p>
i&apos;m quite a reserved person. it&apos;s quite hard for me to verbally express my
wishes. i often don&apos;t even know what i want. and when i do, then i worry that if
i express it to the other person, they will get offended about me and it just
ruins the relationship. i&apos;m always on the lookout for things that make human
interactions a little bit easier.
</p>

<p>
i like receiving and giving touch quite much. but people have very diverse
preferences about what is an okay touch and what is not. so i tend to err on the
conservative side and just keep to myself. otherwise i&apos;d need to communicate
with people. fortunately i found a very nice but very simple game that can free
up people from all the worries when it comes to touch. and you can play this
with any willing person. it&apos;s called the &quot;3 minute game&quot; and was popularized by
betty martin.
</p>

<p>
first, let&apos;s talk about some aspects of the &quot;wheel of consent&quot;, or a simplified
version of it. each act a human does can be categorized into one of the
following 4 dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  giving: i&apos;m doing something to someone for their benefit
</li><li>
  receiving: someone does something to me for my own benefit
</li><li>
  taking: i&apos;m doing something to someone for my own benefit
</li><li>
  allowing: someone does something to me for their benefit
</li>
</ul>

<p>
they complement each other. when person a is giving to b, then b is receiving.
if person a is taking from b, person b is allowing. you can draw this in a fancy
circle, that&apos;s where the name &quot;wheel of consent&quot; comes from.
</p>

<p>
how much giving, receiving, taking, allowing a person does, matters. each person
has a healthy limit for each dimension. going over we get to the &quot;shadow sides&quot;
of the dimensions:
</p>

<ul><li>
  too much giving: martyr, self sacrificer
</li><li>
  too much receiving: freeloader, entitled
</li><li>
  too much taking: raper, stealer
</li><li>
  too much allowing: pushover, endurer
</li>
</ul>

<p>
you want to ensure that every act for everyone involved remains in the inner,
non-shadow side of the dimensions.
</p>

<p>
next up, you really need to understand which dimension each act is in for each
person involved. suppose you regularly do an activity (e.g. foot massage). you
think you are doing it as a favor for person b so you are in the giving
dimension. for the other person that activity is in the allowing dimension. they
let you do it because they think you like doing it. but giving and allowing are
not complementary dimensions. it turns out nobody really wants that activity yet
none of the people involved realize this. this is basically a variant of the
abilene paradox. there&apos;s also the flipside to this: you often don&apos;t do some acts
because you think the other person wouldn&apos;t like it. however it might be the
case they would allow you to experiment with it. but you don&apos;t even ask because
of the fear of rejection.
</p>

<p>
the &quot;3 minute game&quot; is a short game that helps you structure communication along
those 4 dimensions. it helps you do activities where it is super clear who it is
for. it consists of four 3 minute rounds. in round 1 player a asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like me to touch you for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person a will be doing something to person b for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective the activity is giving, from
person b&apos;s perspective it is a receiving activity. keep in mind that person a
shouldn&apos;t sink to the shadow sides of their dimension, they should only do what
they are comfortable to give to the other person. in other words they have to
consent to the act. if person a is not happy with the arrangement, they might
negotiate a little bit what their limits are and then agree on that. on the
flipside person b might just want a boring neck massage. it doesn&apos;t have to
sexual all the time. person a has to accept that in this round it&apos;s all about
person b&apos;s wishes. once everybody is happy agreed on the activity, person a does
the agreed on touch for 3 minutes. then person b thanks for person a for this.
</p>

<p>
in round 2, player a again asks player b:
</p>

<ul><li>
  how would you like to touch me for 3 minutes?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
this means person b will be doing something to person a for person b&apos;s benefit.
per above definitions from person a&apos;s perspective this is allowing, while from
person b&apos;s perspective this is taking. the same negotiation and consent process
happens just as before. person b might be very horny and might want to crazy
stuff. person a must realize that this is fine to express and that they don&apos;t
have to succumb to the shadow side, they can refuse and person b shall respect
that otherwise they are succumbing to the shadow side. once agreed, person b
does the activity for 3 minutes. again, since this was for person b&apos;s benefit,
person b thanks person a for the act.
</p>

<p>
round 3 and 4 is the same as round 1 and 2 but with the other person asking the
questions. the whole thing takes about 15 minutes and is worth every minute of
it.
</p>

<p>
this game might sound a little bit silly at first. but what makes it truly
remarkable is that it makes you stop for a minute and think. the question might
initially look simple enough but answering them often is quite hard. it&apos;s very
rare that we get a question on what we want. often i don&apos;t even know what sort
of touch i really want but this lets me think deep on what sort of thing would
fill me up now the best. and i can be very selfish in these thoughts, i don&apos;t
need to play an internal chess to ensure whatever i want is something compatible
with my partner. or that if i ask for this particular thing then my relationship
would spoil a bit. the flipside is true too: my partner can think of anything.
even if i don&apos;t really like the requested activity, i&apos;m certainly willing to
give it 3 minutes, whatever it is. it can be a really freeing sensation once you
experience this game in a safe and supportive environment. you feel like you can
ask for anything and not be judged. you can say anything you want. i haven&apos;t
really tried it in a non-sexual environment so i don&apos;t know how well it works
there but i&apos;d suspect it should hold up quite well there as well. you can see
sample sessions from such environment in betty&apos;s original videos and you can
see the participants happy with the game. betty&apos;s videos are well worth a watch.
</p>

<p>
in the original documentation of this game, betty mentions that this is a game
for 2 or more people. the &quot;or more&quot; version is quite intriguing to me. she
didn&apos;t really explain that part as far as i remember. i&apos;m not entirely sure how
that would work. e.g. how could 3 people play this game? i think what you can do
is that rather than a single person asking the questions, 2 people ask the
questions together to the 3rd person. the third person then can come up with
activities that involve the first two people doing something to the third and
only proceed with the act if everyone agrees to it without succumbing to the
shadow sides. i guess that&apos;s how the &quot;or more&quot; works: each round a selected
person has to ask the group for something they can do together for the selected
person&apos;s benefit. it probably scales okay to 4 people but afterwards i&apos;d imagine
it has way too much communication overhead. never tried this though so not sure
how transformative experience the group setting is yet.
</p>

<p>
the wheel of consent itself is a quite generic concept. it can apply in other
cases as well, not just the above game. e.g. you get invited to a party. do you
go or not? who benefits from you going to the party? it is an interesting
viewpoint to see our activities from. and things can get complicated: you only
benefit from the party if some other person also goes. and that other person
only benefits if you go. now you have these complex, conditional scenarios that
i can&apos;t really wrap my head around yet, so i&apos;ll not dig into this aspect. i&apos;m
just trying to popularize this wheel of consent concept because looks like it&apos;s
a useful framework to work with.
</p>

<p>
if you ever try this game then let me know how it went and what your experiences
with it were.
