# about: short intro about this site.

welcome to notech.ie! i noticed that these days i am surrounded with fancy
technology. however over time i thought a lot and realized that that all this
unnecessary technology and general complexity around is making me unhappy. i
became a luddite to keep my sanity. sysadmin at day, technophobic at night. it
is not that i think technology is bad for humanity, i just have a bad personal
relationship with it. i need to vent about this someplace so i bought this
corner of the internet for myself to do so. among other things i loathe html,
css, capital letters so the content on this site is served as plainly as
possible in all lowercase. this way i can avoid dealing with all that baloney
just to jot some thoughts down. if for some reason you want to talk to me, write
an email to flubber at notech.ie.

fun fact: this site is available through the gopher protocol as well. if you do
not want to use the browser to read this, just use netcat on a linux:

 nc notech.ie 70 <<< /about

github.com/ypsu/notech hosts the backup and history of this blog.

edit from 2021:
over the years i managed to curb my addictions
and deal with complexity a bit better.
i think writing out my frustrations helped.
generally i still agree with most of the stuff i wrote before
but now i made the frontpage into a html page.
that is a clear indication that i'm softening.
who knows, maybe in 10 years i'll decide
to serve my posts in html rather than manually wrapped plaintext files
or start using uppercase letters even.
