# about: short intro about this site.

i'm a random guy born late 1980s currently working at a random tech megacorp as a sysadmin.
this blog started with me wanting
to rant about some daily annoyances when it comes to using computers.
i chose the name "notech" as a play on how nice the world would be without all the computers and technology.
but after some writing and reflection that well ran quickly dry
so i just started writing about some very personal struggles and random ideas.

i found that writing things helps me put things into order.
so i write about all stuff my brain keeps spinlooping about.
most of those things don't make much sense even after writing them down
but at least i spinloop about them less.
this site is for myself, don't expect any quality posts here. :)
