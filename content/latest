<h2 id="hierarchies">hierarchies</h2>
<p>
file hierarchies are an effective way to organize a large set of documents,
like, source code trees, personal files, photos or music collections. however i
often see quite deep hierarchies for these files. i think that is a bad idea.
the nesting should be quite shallow. most projects or organizations do not need
more than 2 levels. anything on top of that probably is not adding a lot of
value and is just making it harder to navigate said files.
</p>

<p>
if i need more than two levels then chances are i am better off with some sort
of database to categorize the files. let me take the hypothetical example of
organizing photos into a directory structure. you might start out with a
structure like this:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/[year]/[name of the event]/[device]/0001.jpg ... 9999.jpg
</pre>

<p>
so when i go skying and make one photo with a phone then two photos with a
camera, i would have these three files:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/2018/skying/phone/0001.jpg
 photos/2018/skying/camera/0001.jpg
 photos/2018/skying/camera/0002.jpg
</pre>

<p>
but would such organization give me any value? whenever i organize something
into directory, i ask myself: will i ever do an operation on all the files under
this directory but not on others? if the answer is no, then clearly i do not
need the extra directory. if the answer &quot;all the time&quot;, then a directory is a
good choice for the organization. if the answer is &quot;sometimes&quot; then it is a
tradeoff. how much annoyance am i adding to my day to day life by putting this
under a directory? i will need extra keypresses, clicks and mental effort
whenever i want to navigate to a set of pictures. it is a small extra cost but
over time it adds up so it is worth to consider.
</p>

<p>
in the above example i do not think that organizing based on the device matters
at all. why should care what device i used after 10 years? i probably long
forgotten about them. so i would get rid of the device directory. on the other
hand the name of the event does matter. i might often want to check out a
specific event i feel nostalgic about. the year is a bit trickier. i probably
will not care about it 99% of the times. i occasionally might want check what
events happened in a specific year but i do not think that i should organize my
files according to that use case. so in this case my structure would look like
this:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/[name of the event]/[timestamp].jpg
</pre>

<p>
so the listing of those 3 files would be the following:
</p>

<pre>
 photos/firstskying/20180112223456.jpg
 photos/firstskying/20180113144455.jpg
 photos/firstskying/20180113144523.jpg
</pre>

<p>
notice that since i can no longer rely on year to separate similar event, i had
to change the name of the event to something more memorable. i went for
&quot;firstskying&quot; in this example since it could represent the photos from my first
skying vacation. on linux i can still easily look up what vacations i went in a
specific year:
</p>

<pre>
 $ ls photos/*/2018* | cut -d2 -f2 | sort -u
</pre>

<p>
and the common task of &quot;look at all the photos from an event&quot; is also very easy:
</p>

<pre>
 $ [pictureapp] photos/firstskying/*
</pre>

<p>
if i were very fancy, i could even add additional tags to the photos (e.g. the
device that made the photo) and store all that in a lightweight database. then i
can use a rich query language to get a list of files for arbitrary conditions.
this solution still does not require directories and easily scales to arbitrary
number of tag types. suppose i add some tags to each photo and then store that
it a text file like this:
</p>

<pre>
 $ cat photodb
 photos/firstskying/20180112223456.jpg night friday phone skying ...
 photos/firstskying/20180113144455.jpg day saturday camera skying ...
 photos/firstskying/20180113144523.jpg day saturday camera skying ...
</pre>

<p>
then it is very easy to query for specific tags and then display just those.
e.g. i remember that i have a funny photo from one of the skying events that
happened on a friday night. then i can search for it like this:
</p>

<pre>
 [pictureapp] $(grep skying photodb | grep friday | grep night | cut -d&apos; &apos; -f1)
</pre>

<p>
probably i could make this a lot smarter and easier to use but the point stands
that if i have lots of documents, then i should not use the directory hierarchy
to over-organize them but rather use a specialized organizing tool or database.
</p>

<p>
in this example i went from 3 levels to 1 level. i find the one level
organization more helpful. it is much simpler, memorable and more accessible.
all it required is some active thought about organization.
</p>

<p>
reorganizing multi-person projects is a little bit trickier though. as an
individual project member i probably do not have a good insight how others use
the project. however we can use conway&apos;s law to help us. it states the
following:
</p>

<ul><li>
  organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs
  which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
at first it sounds as something bad. but when i thought a little bit more about
this, i think this law is something i should embrace rather than work against.
suppose i have a news site and i want to track its source and content in a
monolithic version control system. this might be the hypothetical history of the
company:
</p>

<ul><li>
  i hire programmers to build an awesome webserver. they work under the
  /webserver directory.
</li><li>
  when the webserver is ready, they also write some scripts to run it. to not
  mix code and scripts, they split the files into /webserver/code and
  /webserver/scripts.
</li><li>
  over time running that awesome webserver turns out to be a lot of work, so i
  hire sysadmins to keep it up. these sysadmins also want to monitor the website
  so they split the scripts into /webserver/scripts/runscripts and
  /webserver/scripts/monitoring.
</li><li>
  i hire writers to write some content. they put their content under /content.
</li><li>
  i want the website to look fancy so i hire some ui designers who put their
  stuff under /webserver/frontend.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so i ended up with this hierarchy:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /content
</li><li>
  /webserver/code
</li><li>
  /webserver/frontend
</li><li>
  /webserver/scripts/runscripts
</li><li>
  /webserver/scripts/monitoring
</li>
</ul>

<p>
with such a hierarchy a significant portion of the project members have to deal
with the /webserver prefix daily completely unnecessary. so instead of
subdividing the project among the lines what sounds logical, i would divide it
along the team boundaries. that is what conway&apos;s law suggests if i twist it hard
enough. so i would have this:
</p>

<ul><li>
  /content
</li><li>
  /frontend
</li><li>
  /scripts/runscripts
</li><li>
  /scripts/monitoring
</li><li>
  /webserver
</li>
</ul>

<p>
each team has its own top level directory under which they can do anything they
wish. most teams do not suffer the unnecessary burden of extra hierarchy. in
such situation if i get annoyed with an overly long path, it is only my team who
i need to convince to refactor the files. the changes under my team&apos;s directory
would not affect other teams too much. i can freely create directories under my
team&apos;s name, i do not need to concern about the fact whether it sounds logical
or not, or seek approvals from other teams. the hierarchy is not really getting
into my way, it is just a tool to divide the land of the shared file tree.
</p>

<p>
this approach leads to a very shallow directories with many entries. that sounds
like a nightmare to manage. but once i am over the initial shock, i actually
find it very efficient. i do not spend ages contemplating whether i should put
the logger.c file under the code/util directory or the code/system directory.
and i do not need remember where i put it either. if i am looking for it, i can
just do a &quot;ls *log*&quot; and find it quite quickly. no need for fancy recursive
searching.
</p>

<p>
a word of warning. i think symlinks should be avoided if possible. there is a
lot of value of every file having a unique path to it. if i start using
symlinks, i might start referring to some files through the symlink and that
would lead to bad habits. having unique paths to files makes referring to the
files clearer. if i use a symlink, i really want it to be obvious. maybe its
name should contain the fact that the file is a symlink, e.g. a .lnk extension.
this way there will be less confusion about the canonicality of a file. it will
be obvious from &quot;/runscripts.lnk/start.sh&quot; that this start.sh does not belong to
a &quot;runscripts&quot; team, it is just a shortened filename.
</p>

<p>
benefits of shallow hierarchies is not restricted to filesystems only. url
structures for websites should be quite shallow too. if i were to operate an
online store then i would keep my products at urls like myshop.com/1234578.
non-numbers would trigger searches. e.g. myshop.com/leather+shoe would search
for leather shoes. i think that is more usable than a url like
myshop.com/search?lang=en&amp;location=us&amp;num=20&amp;query=leather+shoes. the former is
easily to remember and share while the latter is a nightmare. i could type out
shareable links for that site without even needing to visit my url to verify
because its structure so simple. you can still create custom, non-search pages
if you put a slash at the end to indicate you are not trying to search. e.g.
myshop.com/login/ could go to the login page without confusing it with a search
query.
</p>

<p>
to sum all the above up: i prefer shallower directory structures because once i
am familiar with the environment, shallow structures make navigation easier for
me. if i find the shallow structure hard to navigate, i try to use a search tool
instead of making overly deep, hierarchical structures.
</p>

<h2 id="money">money</h2>
<p>
money can be practical tool or a cause of big stress in life. it depends how
much you have. have less than what you need then you are causing problems to
yourself, having more than you need then you are making your future self
happier. it would be nicer if the stressing part could go away. does humanity
even need money? as a kid, i did not really need it. my family provided for
everything. even neighbors, relatives often brought gifts or cooked food without
expecting anything in return. i only needed money when i was interacting with
strangers. those strangers did not know me, did not trust me so they needed an
alternative way of giving their goods without feeling bad about themselves. so i
used money there. i guess i could say money is an alternative to trust. it is
not as powerful but still, a simple, one dimensional tool. however i much
preferred the world where things were not reduced to this one dimension. in fact
if i am doing a small favor to someone, i refuse to accept money. that would
just convert this rich sense of trust i acquired into numbers. i would rather
keep the trust than the money. often it is unclear how much money should actions
convert into. even if you assign a value, it changes over time. in the meantime
trust remains constant.
</p>

<p>
i often wonder if such moneyless living is still possible in adulthood. i could
imagine a community of people who live together and agree to share the costs of
living in exchange to not deal with the costs individually. for instance this
group of people might live in a large, multi bedroom shared house with a single,
shared bank account. each person makes a periodic fixed contribution to the bank
account. then the &quot;finance person&quot; pays the bills and rents from that said bank
account. the kitchen is also shared and somebody always fills it up from the
shared bank account. somebody might cook something nice for everybody every day.
maybe group would share bus passes, swimming pool passes or access rights to
other luxuries. the point is that the everyday life does not depend money. the
community members do not need to take their your purse or credit card for rents,
bills or food. that would be quite nice way of living. i am prone to obsess
about spending. i see almost all spending of mine as some sort of inefficiency
and then i start researching and thinking how can i optimize my behavior so that
my spending goes nearer to zero. however if i do not see the bills, i do fine,
blissfully ignorant. the missus already learned that she is better off if she
hides the bills away from me.
</p>

<p>
such shared living does not scale infinitely though. to maintain harmony all
members have to be in sync with each other. they have to have shared values,
house rules and matching personality. maybe it scales up to a dozen of people
tops although i think 4 adults is about the ideal number. finding the right
people is really important. i lived in a few environments and i learned that if
i leave my roommates or living mates up to chance, i will not like it. however
if i pick people i like, it actually enhances my quality of life compared to
living alone or just with a partner. i am really conscious how my words affect
other people so i usually withdraw from conversations just to be safe. i just
listen to others talk. however if i know every person well enough in my
immediate vicinity, i feel more free to talk. so living among friends gives more
opportunity for idle chit chat and other activities which can often be quite
entertaining and fun that i otherwise would not enjoy among strangers or other
acquaintances. the problem is i have not found a good way to easily find the
right people. but that and shared living is a different can of worms.
</p>

<p>
in such arrangements i do not need to think about buying my own food anymore. if
kitchen is always stocked, i can grab some food from there anytime. no more
obsessing about bills. i outsourced my worries to &quot;my tribe&quot;. even if i am
thinking about an expensive purchase of a luxury, like buying a used fixie bike
because i suddenly want to go on a bike tour, i can ask the help of my tribe.
they can verify if this is a sane reason for spending the money, and if so they
can help me with the purchase. they can help negotiate prices, do the financial
transactions and so on. i do not even have to personally think about money. i
trade with trust within my tribe members and on a higher level the tribes trade
with money between each other.
</p>

<p>
maybe a very limited form of the above thoughts could scale up to a larger
community as well. imagine a small but densely occupied town. this town could
have provide cheap free food for whoever that wants it (within limits, e.g. you
have eat everything right at serving). if it serves cheap porridge or just stale
bread every day, that is fine too. maybe it could even have a nearby facility
with clean water and warm rooms. maybe even allow sleeping there. think of
nothing fancy, just mattresses on the floor, rooms perhaps shared with others.
the barest minimum to satisfy the lowest level in the maslow&apos;s hierarchy of
needs. i think keeping up such a facility would not cost a lot of money. most of
the cost would go into the salaries of people running the facility. and probably
nobody would want to use such facilities willingly (i guess i would be an
exception). however having such facility available would mean that no matter
what you have or not have, simple living is available for everyone for free. i
think having free, no questions asked access to the facilities for the basic
needs should be the marker of advanced society. money, trading and access to
luxuries can come after that. i feel just simply giving a lot of money to people
is less effective way to a prosperous civilization. i am not against it, it is
just i think we should not base our pillars of society on money but rather on
infrastructure. once the latter is in place, money can flow freely. let me
demonstrate on a few examples why i think infrastructure would be a better
solution over the long term:
</p>

<ul><li>
  societal integration between the haves and havenots: with free money i think
  this would just decline. from what i can see, rent in cities keeps growing. if
  the poor people do not have access to subsidized housing, they will be forced
  out of the city. thus cities will only house the rich and elites of humanity.
  i think our society should be inclusive and come up with ways that diverse set
  of people can live together, regardless of their income. the people who want
  isolation are the ones who should move out of the cities.
</li><li>
  motivation: if i have to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress and eat the same
  crappy porridge every day, i would be probably intrinsically motivated to do
  something about it. even the slightest extra income can grant me access to a
  luxury. maybe i can get someone give or pay me a decent lunch if i cut their
  grass. maybe then i will be motivated to go back for that extra income. with
  free money, i can decide to save money by keeping my room&apos;s temperature lower
  and then afford a decent lunch every day but otherwise i can still just stay
  at home and do nothing useful, e.g. writing articles like these. the point is
  that the difference between no job and some job is much larger and thus more
  motivating.
</li><li>
  homelessness: in the free money situation people can still stay homeless if
  they for some reason do not have access to money. i might be visiting a
  different city and i might lose my wallet and phone. now i cannot get
  accomodation. in the free infrastructure scenario it is no big deal. i can
  actually decide to go without the wallet because i can food and a bed for free
  anyways.
</li><li>
  stability: the current monetary system does not look super stable to me.
  people will always argue how much money should i get. and even if i get some
  money, the next day it might become worthless because some rogue algorithm
  messed up the whole financial system. infrastructure sounds a more stable
  proposition. just because new york exploded, does not mean that the porridge
  reserves in my town evaporate into air. i can still rely on receiving food the
  next day.
</li><li>
  system understanding: in my opinion it is important for the members of a
  community to understand how their community works so that they easily help
  out. understanding infrastructure is much easier than understanding the
  financial system. the goal of the infrastructure is to satisfy the needs of
  its users. the problems that can arise are usually technical in nature. if
  there is no water then somebody can go and repair the pipes or get water via
  alternative means. if the rent is too high in a city, people cannot just go
  and make it lower.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and the ideal way to design such &quot;living infrastructure&quot; is to have the
designers actually live in the infrastructure they designed. they would have an
intrinsic motivation to ensure it works well. i am sure they could come up with
a long list of reasons why it would not suit them but so would anyone else. this
is why this requirement is needed: to design something that actually works.
</p>

<p>
note that i do not advocate against money or even against giving people free
money. i think that is all fine. what i argue for is that one should not require
money just to co-exist happily on this planet. it is useful for trading,
building new things. but humanity should have a minimum standard of living that
is not based on the fictional money but rather on the actual needs of the
planet&apos;s inhabitants. once most people have access to that, money can be seen as
a tool for the extra benefits society provides. until that happens, i will see
money as something to stress about.
</p>

<h2 id="cars">cars</h2>
<p>
i currently live in a high density area and i learned to despise cars. they are
noisy, inefficient and take up way too much space. there is no place for cars in
inner cities. in fact allowing cars makes a few things more inefficient:
</p>

<ul><li>
  the road and parking infrastructure takes up a lot of space, pushing
  everything even more distant from each other further excarberating the need
  for assisted transportation.
</li><li>
  having cars around slows down walking through the city because i now need to
  wait for the cars to pass whenever i cross streets.
</li><li>
  walking around is more stressing because of the extra noise and awareness
  needed due to the cars. it is much harder to meditate thorough my walk.
</li><li>
  people using cars do not use the public transportation system, so it has less
  chance improving. i often hear people use cars just because they do not like
  the public transportation. but that is just because they do not complain in a
  way that is visible to the public transportation. if they were forced to use
  the service, they would be intrinsically motivated to improve it one way or
  another.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
i understand that cars are very practical tools but i believe over the long term
they lead to less efficient cities. and no matter how technologically advanced
we make cars, city dwellers simply should not require cars. but as long as we
allow cars in the cities, a lot of people will not be able to imagine existing
without them. there is a quick way to teach people living without cars though.
just ban all cars except the public transportation, ambulances and other
licensed infrastructure supporting vehicles. perhaps the transition should be
slower than an overnight ban but the endgoal should be the complete ban. maybe
start with a small inner circle for the ban and then slowly extend the ban with
more and more nearby streets every year until after a decade or two the whole
city is car free. this would be a shock for a lot of people. they will get used
to it though and find creative alternatives to whatever things they required
cars for. if a population is forced to evolve, it will evolve. if some people
still miss sitting in cars, they can always go live on the countryside. in
exchange city dwellers can enjoy the efficiencies and benefits of car-free
living.
</p>

<h2 id="gps">gps</h2>
<p>
the global positioning system is a marvel of human engineering, no doubt at
that. however i really wish it would not exist. my personal beef with the gps is
sucks the fun out of the exploration. i owned a smartphone for about a year
before i threw it away so i do have some experience with gps and navigation. in
those days whenever i wanted to go to any place, i just simply put in the
destination into the device and then followed the path it devised. rather than
looking up and learning about my environment, i was looking down to my phone,
following the arrow and only looked up occasionally to check which street i have
to turn onto. basically i felt that my phone reduced me to a mindless drone. i
was completely fine before the gps, never felt that i was missing it but after
the phone ditch event i felt some withdrawal effect from it. i was even a bit
afraid to venture outside just because i might get lost. however i feel much
happier without it. whenever i want to go to a place i have not been yet, i have
to plan ahead. i have to study the map. i have to learn about large landmarks
that can guide my path. i can perhaps walk through the path virtually through a
street view application. i even draw myself a minimap just in case i do not
remember all the details. then i can execute the journey. during the journey i
am very attentive to my environment. i am sort of in the csíkszentmihályi like
flow where my mind is quietly alert and focused on one thing. i am also very
confident because i know what i expect at every corner. and when i successfully
get to my journey i am quite happy that i planned well and managed to execute
that plan successfully. or maybe i feel happy because of the flow state i was in
for long time. so having no gps, makes my life more fun.
</p>

<p>
okay so i do not need gps but then why do i say it should not even exist? my
problem is that i do know that it is very easy to get hooked on it. once hooked
it is very hard to imagine life without it. people will forget that there are
others who do not have access to gps devices. they will not learn to give
directions in an effective way. they will not create landmarks that simplify
navigation. so my problem is that if society gets overly dependent on gps then
that society will be harder to navigate through without the gps because there
will be no intrinsic motivation to make it simple. basically it will make the
towns and other places less accessible.
</p>

<p>
it even ruins videogames. when i play an open world game, it usually has some
sort of waypoint system so i am just reduced to mindlessly following the
waypoint there too. i do not even look at all the nice scenes the game artists
created for me to enjoy. there is no exploration required. sure, i could turn
off the navigation system but then the game becomes unplayable because the
quests in the game do not fully explain the destination and often there is no
good way to look up a route to the destination and then following that route
without constantly checking the minimap if i am at the place i am supposed to be
or not. this is the effect i was talking about: if people assume that gps
exists, they will not make the place accessible for non-gps users.
</p>

<p>
what i would really wish instead that we would make navigating the world so
simple that a gps is just not needed. suppose a city is organized into a grid of
roads and all the roads are just numbered sequentially. such city would be
boring. but navigating would be super simple because you only need two numbers
to specify a location in it. you can get to that location from any given
location without a map. we should have more like that. so whenever you are
coming up with organization scheme for physical space, try to come up with a way
that does not require navigation tools. make it boring. boring structures make
me happy. please make me happy.
</p>

<p>
and the other problem with universal gps access is the privacy violations it
leads to. large organizations or family might want to know where each member is
at any given moment which usually does not lead to trusting relationships. it is
a silly idea at this point but as technology proliferates it might become more
and more accepted. i might only want to track track my children at first for
their own &quot;safety&quot;. when i fully make terms with that arrangement, i start
thinking of tracking a spouse for their &quot;safety&quot;. then when i get terms with
that arrangement, i might want start tracking more and more family members and
so they want track me in exchange. now everybody is tracking everybody&apos;s
movements. then when governments want to track me for my own own &quot;safety&quot;, i
might not be objecting to it because it is now &quot;normal&quot; to track people. the
situation is horrible at this point. the whole thing escalates in baby steps. it
is better to stop the whole thing in its roots and just live in a way that does
not require the knowledge of one&apos;s position on this planet.
