the problem with plain text is that it does not really have a standard on how to
rewrap it to other column sizes. i do not mind this, i just assume 80 columns as
the universal width. however that does not play nice with kindle. it wraps
plaintext quite awfully. there is not much it can do with plaintext. it can do a
much better job with html. i quite dislike html but it is a widely used and
supported format so it will do for this purpose. i have the full contents of
this blog available in html at html.notech.ie. i host this on a separate server
(github) because my little server only works for small, <100k files. this
limitation prevents me from creating overly long documents.

html.notech.ie contains the whole blog on one large site with minimal formatting
so it is very easy to either open on kindle's browser or just download and
convert it to a .mobi file. i wish more blogs and sites would allow easy binge
reading.

note that i do not limit document width in the generated html because i think
that is rude. making the text narrower is always easier. i can make the browser
window narrower, use firefox's responsive design mode or its reading view, or
just open the javascript console and enter "document.body.style.width =
'30em';". making a document wider needs a phd in css.
